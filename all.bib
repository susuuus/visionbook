To exploit this information, it is necessary to understand how images are formed and what determines the observed intensity in the image. The gradient space, popularized by Huffman and Mackworth in a slightly different context, is a helpful tool in the development of new methods.},

The illusion can be observed in a wide variety of special moving stimuli that either disadvantage or fatigue the motion systems to the point where no motion is perceived but where the shape, texture, color, and depth systems are still able to function sufficiently to extract a stable image from the moving display. It demonstrates that visual processing systems for attributes such as shape, texture, color, and depth extract stable representations from moving images; only visual motion systems are capable of producing the sensation of motion.}",
