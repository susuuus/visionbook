# Challenges in Learning-Based Vision {#sec-challenges-in-learning-based-vision}

Learning-based vision comes with a unique set of challenges. This approach to vision derives rules from *data*, and therefore requires tools for understanding where data can go wrong. This part of the book first presents several failure modes of data-driven methods and then provides tools for mitigating these failures.

## Outline

- **Chapter @sec-bias_and_shift** introduces the problem of dataset bias and distribution shift. We also encounter the issue of adversarial examples. These problems all come down to a gap between how the model is trained and how it will be used.

- **Chapter @sec-data_augmentation** presents one way of dealing with this gap: train on a more diverse distribution of data.

- **Chapter @sec-transfer_learning** presents a second way of dealing with the gap: adapt your models to bridge the gap.
