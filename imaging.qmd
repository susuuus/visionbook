# Imaging {#sec-imaging}

## Introduction

Light sources, like the sun or artificial lights, flood our world with
light rays. These reflect off surfaces, generating a field of light rays
heading in all directions through space. As the light rays reflect from
the surfaces, they generally change in some attributes, such as their
brightness or their color. It is those changes, after reflection from a
surface, that let us interpret what we see. In this chapter, we describe
how light interacts with surfaces and how those interactions are
recorded with a camera.

## Light Interacting with Surfaces {#sec-light_interacting_with_surfaces}

Visible light is electromagnetic radiation, exhibiting wave effects like
diffraction. For many imaging models, however, it is helpful to
introduce the abstraction of a **light ray**, describing the light
radiation heading in a particular direction from a particular location
in space (). A light ray is specified by its position, direction, and
intensity as a function of wavelength and polarization. In this
treatment, we ignore diffraction effects.

![A light ray from the sun strikes a surface and generates outgoing rays
of intensity and color depending on the angles of the incoming and
outgoing rays relative to the surface
orientation.](figures/imaging/brdf.png){#fig-lightSpray width="70%"}

Let an incident light ray be from direction $\mathbf{p}$ and of power,
$\ell_{\texttt{in}}(\lambda)$, as a function of spectral wavelength $\lambda$ ().
The power of the outgoing light, reflected in the direction,
$\mathbf{q}$, is determined by what is called the **bidirectional
reflection distribution function** (BRDF), $F$, of the surface. If the
surface normal is $\mathbf{n}$, then outgoing power is some function,
$F$, of the surface normal, the incoming and outgoing ray directions,
the wavelength, and the incoming light power:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}} = F \left( \ell_{\texttt{in}}, \mathbf{n}, \lambda, \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q} \right)
$$ {#eq-Lambert}

### Lambertian Surfaces

In general, BRDFs can be quite complicated (see @Matusik2002),
describing both diffuse and specular components of reflection. Even
surfaces with completely diffuse reflections can give complicated
reflectance distributions @Oren1994. A useful approximation describing
diffuse reflection is the **Lambertian model**, with a particularly
simple BRDF, which we denote as $F_L$. The outgoing ray intensity,
$\ell_{\texttt{out}}$, is a function only of the surface orientation relative to the
incoming and outgoing ray directions, the wavelength, a scalar surface
reflectance, and the incoming light power:
$$%I_{\mbox{out}} = F_{L}(I_{\mbox{in}} (\lambda), \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{p})  = a I_{\mbox{in}}(\lambda) \cos(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p}),
\ell_{\texttt{out}} = F_{L} \left( \ell_{\texttt{in}} (\lambda), \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{p} \right)  = a \ell_{\texttt{in}}(\lambda) \left( \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p} \right),
$${#eq-lambert}

where $a$ is the surface **reflectance**, or
**albedo**, $\mathbf{n}$ is the surface normal vector, and $\mathbf{p}$
points toward the source of the incident light. Note that the brightness
of the outgoing light ray depends on the orientation of the surface
relative to the incident ray, as well as the reflectance, $a$, of the
surface. For a Lambertian surface, the intensity of the reflected light
is a function of the direction of the incoming light ray, but not a
function of the outgoing direction of the ray, $\mathbf{q}$.

### Specular Surfaces

A widely used model of surfaces with a specular component of reflection
is the **Phong reflection model** @Phong1975. The light reflected from a
surface is assumed to have three components that result in the observed
reflection: (1) an ambient component, which is a constant term added to
all reflections; (2) a diffuse component, which is the Lambertian
reflection of ; and (3) a specular reflection component. For a given ray
direction, $\mathbf{q}$, from the surface, the Phong specular
contribution, $\ell_{\mbox{Phong spec}}$, is:
$$\ell_{\mbox{Phong spec}} = k_s (\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{q})^\alpha \ell_{\texttt{in}},$$
where $k_s$ is a constant, $\alpha$ is a parameter governing the spread
of the specular reflection, and the unit vector $\mathbf{r}$ denotes the
direction of maximum specular reflection, given by
$$\mathbf{r} = 2(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{p}$$
shows the ambient, Lambertian, and Phong shading components of a sphere
under two-source illumination, and a comparison with a real sphere under
similar real illumination.

many extra details required of a photorealistic rendering.</figcaption>
</figure>

In general, surface reflection behaves linearly: the reflection from the
sum of two light sources is the sum of the reflections from the
individual sources.

To associate the reflected light with surfaces in the world, we need to
know which light rays came from which direction in space. That requires
that we form an image, which we discuss next.

## The Pinhole Camera and Image Formation {#sec:pinhole_camera_formation}

Naively, we might wonder when looking at a blank wall, why we don't see
an image of the scene facing that wall. The light reflected from the
wall integrates light from every reflecting surface in the room, so the
reflected intensities are an average of light intensities from many
different directions and many different sources, as illustrated in .

Mathematically, integrating the equation for Lambertian reflections (@eq-Lambert) over all possible incoming light directions
$\mathbf{p}$, we have for the intensity reflecting off a Lambertian
surface, $\ell_{\texttt{out}}$:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}} = \int_{\mathbf{p}}  a \ell_{\texttt{in}}(\mathbf{p}) \cos(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p}) \mbox{d} \mathbf{p}$$
The intensity, $\ell_{\texttt{out}}$, reflecting off a diffuse wall, thus tells us
very little about the incoming light intensity $\ell_{\texttt{in}}(\mathbf{p})$ from
any given direction $\mathbf{p}$. To learn about $\ell_{\texttt{in}}(\mathbf{p})$,
we need to form an image. Forming an image involves identifying which
rays came from which directions. The role of a camera is to organize
those rays, to convert the cacophony of light rays going everywhere to a
set of measurements of intensities coming from different directions in
space, and thus from different surfaces in the world.

Perhaps the simplest camera is a **pinhole camera**. A pinhole camera
requires a light-tight enclosure, a small hole that lets light pass, and
a projection surface where one senses or views the illumination
intensity as a function of position. shows the the geometry of a scene,
the pinhole, and a projection surface (wall). For any given point on the
projection surface, the light that falls there comes from only from one
direction, along the straight line joining the surface position and the
pinhole. This creates an image of what's in the world on the projection
plane.

camera restricts the light rays reaching the wall, producing an image to
appear.](figures/imaging/no_picture_on_a_wall_aina.png){#fig-wallpicture

Making pinhole cameras is easy and it is a good exercise to gain an
intuition of the image projection process. The picture in shows a very
simple setup similar to the diagram from . This setup is formed by two
pieces of paper, one with a hole on it. With the right illumination
conditions you can see an image projected on the white piece of paper in
front of the opening. You can use this very simple setup to see the
effect of changing the distance between the projection plane and the
pinhole.

![A simple setting for creating images on a white piece of paper. In
front of the white piece of paper we place another piece of black paper
with a hole in the middle. The black paper projects a shadow on the
white paper and, in the middle of the shadow, appears a picture of the
scene in front of the hole. By making the hole large you will get a
brighter, but blurrier

One sticks their head inside the bag, which has been padded to be
opaque. We encourage readers to make their own pinhole camera designs.
The needed elements are an aperture to let light through, mechanisms to
block stray light, a projection screen, and some method to view or
record the image on the projection screen.

</figure>

We started the section asking why there are no pictures on regular walls
and explaining that, for an image to appear, we need some way of
restricting the rays that hit the wall so that each location only gets
rays from different directions. The pinhole camera is one way of forming
a picture. But the reality is that, in most settings, light rays are
restricted by accidental surfaces present in the space (other walls,
ceiling, floor, obstacles, etc.). For instance, in a room, light rays
are entering the room via a window, and therefore some of the rays are
blocked. In general, the lower part of a wall will see the top of the
world outside the window, while the top part of the wall will see the
bottom part of the world outside the window. As a consequence, most
walls will appear as having a faint blue tone on the bottom because they
reflect the sky, as shown in .

### Image Formation by Perspective Projection

A pinhole camera projects 3D coordinates in the world to 2D positions on
the projection plane of the camera through the straight line path of
each light ray through the pinhole (). The simple geometry of the camera
lets us identify the projection by inspection. The sketch in shows a
pinhole camera and the relevant terminology.

![Coordinate systems. In computer vision it is common to use the
**right-hand rule** for choosing the orientation of the 3D coordinate
axes.](figures/imaging/pinhole_names2.png){#fig-pinhole_names
width=".7"}

shows the pinhole camera of but with the box removed, leaving visible
the projection plane. shows the definition of the three coordinate
systems that we will use:

-   **World coordinates**. Let the origin of a World Cartesian
    coordinate system be the camera's pinhole. The coordinates of 3D
    position of a point, $\mathbf{P}$, in the world will be
    $\mathbf{P} = (X, Y, Z)$, where the Z axis is perpendicular to the
    camera's sensing plane (projection plane).

-   **Camera coordinates** in the **virtual camera plane**. The camera
    projection plane is behind the pinhole and at a distance $f$ of the
    origin. Let the coordinates in the camera projection plane, $x$ and
    $y$, be parallel to the world coordinate axes $X$ and $Y$ but in
    opposite directions, respectively. For simplicity, it is useful to
    create a virtual camera plane that is radially symmetrical to the
    projection plane with respect to the origin and it is placed in
    front of the camera (\[a\]). This virtual camera plane will create a
    projected image without the inversion of the image. The coordinates
    in the virtual camera plane will have the same sign as the world
    coordinates, that is, with the same $x$,$y$ coordinates (i.e., both
    images are identical apart from a flip).

-   **Image coordinates**, shown in , are typically measured in pixels.
    Both the camera coordinate system $(x,y)$ and the image coordinate
    system $(n,m)$ are related by an affine transform as we will discuss
    later.

![(a) Geometry of the pinhole camera. A 3D point $\mathbf{P}$ projects
into the location $\mathbf{p}$ in the projection plane, located at a
distance $f$ of the pinhole. The virtual camera plane is a radially
symmetric projection of the camera plane. (b) Relation between the
camera, $(x,y)$, and the image coordinate system
$(n,m)$.](figures/imaging/pinhole_geometry2.png){#fig-pinholeGeometry
width="100%"}

If the distance from the sensing plane to the pinhole is $f$ (see ) then
similar triangles gives us the following relations: 

$$\begin{align}
x & = & f \frac{X}{Z}
\end{align}$$ {#eq-perspctiveProj1}

$$\begin{align}
y & = & f \frac{Y}{Z} 
\end{align}$${#eq-perspctiveProj}

Equations @eq-perspctiveProj1 and @eq-perspctiveProj are called the **perspective projection
equations**. Under perspective projection, distant objects become
smaller, through the inverse scaling by $Z$. As we will see, the
perspective projection equations apply not just to pinhole cameras but
to most lens-based cameras, and human vision as well.

![Perspective projection equations derived geometrically. From similar
triangles, we have $x/f = X/Z$ and $y/f = Y/Z$. Similar triangles are
indicated by the same
color.](figures/imaging/similar_triangles2.png){#fig-pinholeGeometry2
width=".7"}

Due to the choice of coordinate systems, the coordinates in the virtual
camera plane have the $x$ coordinate in the opposite direction than the
way we usually do for image coordinates $(m,n)$, where $m$ indexes the
pixel column and $n$ the pixel row in an image. This is shown in . The
relationship between camera coordinates and image coordinates is
$$\begin{aligned}
n & = & - a x + n_0\\
m & = & a y + m_0
\label{eq-cameratoimagecoordinates}
\end{aligned}$$ where $a$ is a constant, and $(n_0, m_0)$ is the image
coordinates of the camera optical axis. Note that this is different than
what we introduced a simple projection model in in the framework of the
simple vision system in . In that example, we placed the world
coordinate system in front of the camera, and the origin was not the
location of the pinhole camera. 

### Image Formation by Orthographic Projection

Perspective projection is not the only feasible projection from 3D
coordinates of a scene down to the 2D coordinates of the sensor plane.
Different camera geometries can lead to other projections. One
alternative to perspective projection is **orthographic projection**.
shows the geometric interpretation of orthographic (or parallel)
projection.

![Orthographic projection. Projection is done by parallel rays
orthogonal to the projection plane. In this example, we have $x = X$ and
$y = Y$.](figures/imaging/orthogonal_projection.png){#fig-orthographics
width=".9"}

In this projection, as the rays are orthogonal to the projection plane,
the size of objects is independent of the distance to the camera. The
projection equations are generally written as follows: $$\begin{aligned}
x & = & k X \nonumber \\
y & = & k Y
\label{eq-orthographicProj}
\end{aligned}$$ where the constant scaling factor $k$ accounts for
change of units and is a fixed global image scaling.

Orthographic projection is a good model for telephoto lenses, where the
apparent size of objects in the image is roughly independent of their
distance to the camera. We used this projection when building the simple
visual system in .

The next section provides another example of a camera producing an
orthographic projection.

### How to Build an Orthographic Camera?

Can we build a camera that has an orthographic projection? What we need
is some way of restricting the light rays so that only perpendicular
rays to the plane illuminate the projection plane.

One such camera is the **soda straw camera**, shown in , which you can
easily build. The example shown in (c) used around 500 straws.

![Straw camera example. (a) View through parallel straws. (b) The
subject is a hand in sunlight. (c) The resulting image of the straw
camera (using smaller straws than (a)). The image projection is
orthographic.](figures/imaging/straw_camera.png){#fig-straw
width="100%"}

A set of parallel straws allow parallel light rays to pass from the
scene to the projection plane, but extinguish rays passing from all
other directions. It works better if the straws are painted black to
reduce internal reflections that might capture light rays not parallel
to the straws, resulting in a less sharp picture.

shows the resulting image when imagining the scene shown in . The straw
camera doesn't invert the image as the pinhole camera does and objects
do not get smaller as they move away from the camera. The image
projection is orthographic, with a unity scale factor; the object sizes
on the projection plane are the same as those of the objects in the
world.

Another implementation of an orthographic camera is the telecentric lens
that combines a pinhole with a lens.

## Concluding Remarks

Light reflects off surfaces and scatters in many directions. Pinhole
cameras allow only selected rays to pass to a sensing plane, resulting
in a perspective projection of the 3D scene onto the sensor. Other
camera configurations can give other image projections, such as
orthographic projections.

At this point, it is a good exercise to build your own pinhole camera
and experiment with it. Building a pinhole camera helps in acquiring a
better intuition about the image formation process.
