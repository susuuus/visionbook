## Preface {#preface .unnumbered}

Dedicated to all the pixels.

## About this Book {#about-this-book .unnumbered}

This book covers foundational topics within computer vision, with an
image processing and machine learning perspective. We want to build the
reader's intuition and so we include many visualizations. The audience
is undergraduate and graduate students who are entering the field, but
we hope experienced practitioners will find the book valuable as well.

Our initial goal was to write a large book that provided a good coverage
of the field. Unfortunately, the field of computer vision is just too
large for that. So, we decided to write a small book instead, limiting
each chapter to no more than five pages. Such a goal forced us to really
focus on the important concepts necessary to understand each topic.
Writing a short book was perfect because we did not have time to write a
long book and you did not have time to read it. Unfortunately, we have
failed at that goal, too.

## Writing this Book {#writing-this-book .unnumbered}

To appreciate the path we took to write this book, let's look at some
data first. shows the number of pages written as a function of time
since we mentioned the idea to MIT press for the first time on November
24, 2010.

Starting to write this book was like entering this cave.

We had no idea what we were getting into.

Writing this book has not been a linear process. As the plot shows, the
evolution of the manuscript length is non-monotonic, with a period when
the book shrank before growing again. Lots of things have happened since
we started thinking about this book in November 2010; yes, it has taken
us more than 10 years to write this book. If we knew on the first day
all the work that is involved in writing a book like this one there is
no way we would have started. However, from today's vantage point, with
most of the work behind us, we feel happy we started this journey. We
learned a lot by writing and working out the many examples we show in
this book, and we hope you will too by reading and reproducing the
examples yourself.

When we started writing the book, the field was moving ahead steadily,
but unaware of the revolution that was about to unfold in less than 2
years. Fortunately, the deep learning revolution in 2012 made the
foundations of the field more solid, providing tools to build working
implementations of many of the original ideas that were introduced in
the field since it began. During the first years after 2012, some of the
early ideas were forgotten due to the popularity of the new approaches,
but over time many of them returned. We find it interesting to look at
the process of writing this book with the perspective of the changes
that were happening in the field. @fig-evolution_pages shows some important events in the
field of artificial intelligence (AI) that took place while writing this
book.

## Structure of the Book {#structure-of-the-book .unnumbered}

Computer vision has undergone a revolution over the last decade. It may
seem like the methods we use now bear little relationship to the methods
of 10 years ago. But that's not the case. The names have changed, yes,
and some ideas are genuinely new, but the methods of today in fact have
deep roots in the history of computer vision and AI. Throughout this
book we will emphasize the unifying themes behind the concepts we
present. Some chapters revisit concepts presented earlier from different
perspectives.

One of the central metaphors of vision is that of multiple **views**.
There is a true physical scene out there and we view it from different
angles, with different sensors, and at different times. Through the
collection of views we come to understand the underlying reality. This
book also presents a collection of views, and our goal will be to
identify the underlying foundations.

The book is organized in multiple parts, of a few chapters each, devoted
to a coherent topic within computer vision. It is preferable to read
them in that order as most of the chapters assume familiarity with the
topics covered before them. The parts are as follows:

**Part I** discusses some motivational topics to introduce the problem
of vision and to place it in its societal context. We will introduce a
simple vision system that will let us present concepts that will be
useful throughout the book, and to refresh some of the basic
mathematical tools.

**Part II** covers the image formation process.

**Part III** covers the foundations of learning using vision examples to
introduce concepts of broad applicability.

**Part IV** provides an introduction to signal and image processing,
which is foundational to computer vision.

**Part V** describes a collection of useful linear filters (Gaussian
kernels, binomial filters, image derivatives, Laplacian filter, and
temporal filters) and some of their applications.

**Part VI** describes multiscale image representations.

**Part VII** describes neural networks for vision, including
convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and
transformers. Those chapters will focus on the main principles without
going into describing specific architectures.

**Part VIII** introduces statistical models of images and graphical
models.

**Part IX** focuses on two powerful modeling approaches in the age of
neural nets: generative modeling and representation learning. Generative
image models are *statistical image models* that create synthetic images
that follow the rules of natural image formation and proper geometry.
Representation learning seeks to find useful abstract representations of
images, such as vector embeddings.

**Part X** is composed of brief chapters that discuss some of the
challenges that arise from building learning-based vision systems.

**Part XI** introduces geometry tools and their use in computer vision
to reconstruct the 3D world structure from 2D images.

**Part XII** focuses on processing sequences and how to measure motion.

**Part XIII** deals with scene understanding and object detection.

**Part XIV** is a collection of chapters with advice for junior
researchers on effective methods of giving presentations, writing
papers, and the mentality of an effective researcher.

**Part XV** returns to the simple visual system and applies some of the
techniques presented in the book to solve the toy problem introduced in
Part I.

## What Do We Not Cover? {#what-do-we-not-cover .unnumbered}

This should be a long section, but we will keep it short. We do not
provide a review on the current state of the art of computer vision; we
focus instead on the foundational concepts. We do not cover in depth the
many applications of computer vision such as shape analysis, object
tracking, person pose analysis, or face recognition. Many of those
topics are better studied by reading the latest publications from
computer vision conferences and specialized monographs.

## Related Books {#related-books .unnumbered}

We want to mention a number of related books that we've had the pleasure
to learn from. For a number of years, we taught our computer vision
class from the *Computer Vision: A Modern Approach* by 
@Forsyth2012, and have also used @Szeliski2011 book, *Computer Vision:
Algorithms and Applications* . These are excellent general
texts. *Robot Vision*, by @Horn86 is an older textbook, but covers
physics-based fundamentals very well. The book that enticed one of us
into computer vision is still in print: *Vision* by @Marr2010. The intuitions are timeless and the writing is wonderful.

The geometry of vision through multiple cameras is covered thoroughly in the classic, *Multiple View Geometry in Computer
Vision* by @Hartley2004. *Solid Shape* by @KoenderinkSolidShape1990, offers a general treatment of three-dimensional (3D)
geometry. Useful and related books include *Three-Dimensional Computer
Vision* by @Faugeras93, and *Introductory Techniques for 3D
Computer Vision* by @Trucco1998.

A number of recent textbooks focus on learning. Our favorites are @mackay2003information, @Bishop2006, @murphy2022,
and @Goodfellow-et-al-2016.
Probabilistic models for vision are well covered in the textbook of @princeCVMLI2012.

*Vision Science: Photons to Phenomenology* by @Palmer1999,
is a wonderful book covering human visual perception. It includes some
chapters discussing connections between studies in visual cognition and
computer vision. This is an indispensable book if you are interested in
the science of vision.

*Signal Processing for Computer Vision* by @Granlund95, covers many basics of low-level vision. Ullman insightfully
addresses *High-level Vision* in his book of that title, @Ullman2000.

Finally, a favorite book of ours, about light and vision, is *Light and
Color in the Outdoors*, by @Minnaert2012, a delightful
treatment of optical effects in nature.
