# Transfer Learning and Adaptation {#sec-transfer_learning}

## Introduction

A common criticism of deep learning systems is that they are data hungry. To learn a new concept (e.g., "is this a dog?") may require showing a deep net thousands of labeled examples of that concept. Conversely, humans can learn to recognize a new kind of animal after seeing it just once, an ability known as **one-shot learning**.


:::{.column-margin}
Correspondingly, **few-shot learning** refers to learning from just a few examples, and the **zero-shot** setting refers to when a model works out of the box on a new problem, with zero adaptation whatsoever.
:::

Humans can do this because we have extensive prior knowledge we bring to
bear to accelerate the learning of new concepts. Deep nets are data
hungry when they are trained from *scratch*. But they can actually be
rather data efficient if we give them appropriate prior knowledge and
the means to use their priors to accelerate learning. Transfer learning
deals with how to use prior knowledge to solve new learning problems
quickly.

Transfer learning is an alternative to the ideas we saw last chapter,
where we simply trained on a broad distribution of data so that most
test queries happen to be things we have encountered before. Because it
is usually impossible to train on *all* queries we might encounter, we
often need to rely on transfer learning to adapt to new kinds of
queries.

## Problem Setting

Suppose you are working at a farm and the drones that water the plants
need to be able to recognize whether the crop is wheat or corn. Using
the machinery we have learned so far, you know what to do: gather a big
dataset of aerial photos of the crops and label each as either wheat or
corn, then, train your favorite classifier to perform the mapping
$f_{\theta}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \{\texttt{wheat}, \texttt{corn}\}$.
It works! The crop yield is plentiful. Now a new season rolls around and
it turns out the value of corn has plummeted. You decide to plant
soybeans instead. So, you need a new classifier; what should you do?

One option is to train a new classifier from scratch, this time on
images of either wheat or soybeans. But you already know how to
recognize wheat; you still have last year's classifier $f_{\theta}$. We
would like to make use of $f_{\theta}$ to accelerate the learning of
this year's new classifier. Transfer learning is the study of how to do
this.

Transfer learning algorithms involve two parts:

1.  **Pretraining**: how to acquire prior knowledge in the first place.

2.  **Adaptation**: how to use prior knowledge to solve a new task.

In our example, the pretraining phase was training the wheat versus corn
classifier, and the adaptation phase is updating that classifier to
instead recognize wheat versus soybeans. This is visualized below in
@fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_basic.

![Transfer learning consists of two phases: first we pretrain a model on one task and then we adapt that model to perform a new task.](./figures/transfer_learning/pretraining_and_adaptation.png){width="85%" #fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_basic}


:::{.column-margin}
The pretraining phase could just be regular training, which we only call *pre*training in retrospect, once we decide to start adapting to a new problem. Or we can specifically design pretraining algorithms that are *only* meant as a warm up for the real event. Representation learning algorithms @sec-representation_learning are of this latter variety.
:::

In the next sections we will describe specific kinds of transfer
learning algorithms, which handle each of these stages in different
ways. Then, in @sec-transfer_learning-combinatorial_catalog, we will
reflect on the landscape of choices we have made, and we will see that
transfer learning is better understood as a collection of tools, which
can be combined in innumerable ways, rather than as a set of specific
named algorithms.

## Finetuning

There are many ways to do transfer learning. We will start with perhaps
the simplest: when you encounter a new task, just keep on learning *as
if nothing happened*.

**Finetuning** consists of initialializing a new classifier with the
parameter vector from the pretrained model, and then training it as
usual. In other words, finetuning is making small (fine) adjustments
(tuning) to the parameters of your model to adapt it to do something
slightly different than what it did before, or even something a lot
different.

There are three stages: (1) pretrain
$f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$, (2) initialize
$f^{\prime} = f$, and (3) finetune
$f^{\prime}: \mathcal{X}^{\prime} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}^{\prime}$. The
full algorithm is written in algorithm
@fig-transfer_learning-finetuning, with $f$ and $f^{\prime}$
indicated as just a continually learning $f_{\theta}$ with different
iterates of $\theta$ as learning progresses.

![](./figures/transfer_learning/fig-transfer_learning-finetuning.png){width="100%" #fig-transfer_learning-finetuning}

Finetuning is simple and works well. But there is one tricky bit we
still need to deal with: What if the structure of $f_{\theta}$ is
incompatible with the new problem we wish to finetune on?

For example, suppose $f$ is a neural net and $\theta$ are the weights
and biases of this net. Then the previous algorithm will only work if
the dimensionality of $\mathcal{X}$ matches the dimensionality of
$\mathcal{X}^{\prime}$, and the same for $\mathcal{Y}$ and
$\mathcal{Y}^{\prime}$. This is because, for our neural net model,
$f_{\theta}$ must have the same shape inputs and outputs regardless of
the values $\theta$ takes on. What if we start with our net trained to
classify between wheat and corn and now want to finetune it to classify
between wheat, corn, and soybeans? The dimensionality of the output has
changed from two classes to three.

To handle this it is common to cut off the last layer of the network and
replace it with a new final layer that outputs the correct
dimensionality. If the input dimensionality changes, you can do the same
with the first layer of the network. Both these changes are shown next,
in @fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_stages.

![](./figures/transfer_learning/fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_stages.png){width="100%" #fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_stages}

To be precise, let $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ decompose as
$f= f_1 \circ f_2 \circ f_3$, with
$f_1: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_1$,
$f_2: \mathcal{Z}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_2$, and
$f_3: \mathcal{Z}_2 \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$. Now we wish to learn a
function
$f^{\prime}: \mathcal{X}^{\prime} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}^{\prime}$,
which decomposes as
$f^{\prime}= f^{\prime}_1 \circ f^{\prime}_2 \circ f^{\prime}_3$, with
$f^{\prime}_1: \mathcal{X}^{\prime} \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_1$,
$f_2: \mathcal{Z}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}_2$, and
$f_3: \mathcal{Z}_2 \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}^{\prime}$. The finetuning
approach here would be to first learn $f$; then, in order to learn
$f^{\prime}$, we initialize $f^{\prime}_2$ with the parameters of $f_2$
and initialize $f^{\prime}_1$ and $f^{\prime}_3$ randomly (i.e., train
these from scratch).

### Finetuning Subparts of a Network

@fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_stages shows that you don't have to
finetune all layers in your network but can selectively finetune some
and initialize others from scratch. In fact this strategy can be applied
quite generally, where we initialize some parts of a computation graph
from pretrained models and initialize others from scratch. There are
many reasons why you might want to do this, or not. Sometimes you might
have pretrained models that can perform just certain parts of what your
full system needs to do. You can use these pretrained models and compose
them together with layers initialized from scratch. Other times you may
want to *freeze* certain layers to prevent them from forgetting their
prior knowledge @zhang2023adding.

An example of both these use cases is given in
@fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_certain_modules_example. In this
example we imagine we are making a system to detect cars in street
images. We have four modules that work together to achieve this. The
`featurize` module converts the input image $\mathbf{x}$ into a feature
map (for example, this could be DINO @caron2021emerging, which we saw in
@sec-perceptual_organization-affinity_based_segmentation).
This module is pretrained and frozen; the idea is we have a good generic
feature extractor that will work for many problems, and we do not need
to update it for each new problem we encounter. Next we have two modules
that take these feature maps as input and extract different kinds of
useful information from them: (1) `depth estimator` predicts the depth
map of the image (geometry), (2) `dense classifier` predicts a class
label per-pixel (semantics). In our example, these two models are
pretrained on generic images but we need to finetune them to work on the
kind of street images we will be applying our detector to. Finally,
given the depth and class predictions, we have a final module,
`detector`, that searches for the image region that has the geometry and
semantics of a car. This module outputs a bounding box $\mathbf{y}$
indicating where it thinks the car is.

We will use the symbol ![](figures/transfer_learning/lock.png){width="10%"} 
to indicate a frozen module and the symbol ![](figures/transfer_learning/fire.png){width="10%"} to indicate a module that is updated during the adaptation phase.
:::


![Finetuning certain subsets of a computation graph. Here we show some modules that have been pretrained (those with a shaded background) and one that is trained from scratch at finetuning time.](./figures/transfer_learning/finetuning_certain_modules_example.png){width="70%" #fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_certain_modules_example}

Within a single layer, it is also possible to update just a subspace of
the full weight matrix. This can be an effective way to save memory
(fewer weight gradients to track during backpropagation) or to
regularize the amount of adaptation you are performing. One popular way
to do so is to apply a low-rank update to the weight matrix @hu2021lora.

### Heads and Probes

As discussed previously, a model can be adapted by changing some or all
of its parameters, or by adding entirely new modules to the computation
graph. One important kind of new module is a **read out** module that
takes some features from the computation graph as input and produces a
new prediction as output. When these modules are linear, they are called
**linear probes**. These modules are relatively lightweight (few
parameters) and can be optimized with tools from linear optimization
(where there are often closed form solutions). Because of this, linear
probes are very popular as a way of repurposing a neural net to perform
a new task. These modules are also useful as a way of assessing what
kind of knowledge each feature map in the original network represents,
in the sense that if a feature map can linearly classify some attribute
of the data, then that feature maps knows something about that
attribute. In this usage, linear probes are probing the knowledge
represented in some layer of a neural net.

## Learning from a Teacher

When we first encountered supervised learning in chapter
@sec-intro_to_learning, we described it as *learning
from examples*. You are given a dataset of example inputs and their
corresponding outputs and the task is to infer the relationship that can
explain these input-output pairs:

![](./figures/transfer_learning/fig-transfer_learning-learning_from_examples.png){width="100%"}

This kind of learning is like having a very lazy teacher, who just gives
you the answer key to the homework questions but does not provide any
explanations and won't answer questions. Taking that analogy forward,
could we learn instead from a more instructive teacher?

One way of formalizing this setting is to consider the teacher as a
well-trained model $t: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ that maps
input queries to output answers. The student (the learner) observes both
data $\{x^{(i)}\}^N_{i=1}$ and has access to the teacher model $t$. The
student can learn to imitate the teacher's outputs or can learn to match
*how the teacher processes the queries*, matching intermediate
activations of the teacher model.

![](./figures/transfer_learning/fig-transfer_learning-learning_from_teacher.png){width="100%"}

:::{.column-margin}
Learning from examples can be considered a special
case of learning from a teacher. It is the case where the teacher is the
world and our only access to the teacher is observing outputs from it,
that is, the examples $y$ that match each input $x$.
:::



### Knowledge distillation

**Knowledge distillation** is a simple and popular algorithm for
learning a classifier from a teacher. We assume that the teacher is a
well-trained classifier that outputs a $K-1$-dimensional probability
mass function (pmf), $t: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \vartriangle^{K-1}$
(see @sec-intro_to_learning-image_classification. The student, a
model $f_{\theta}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \vartriangle^{K-1}$, simply
tries to imitate the teacher's output pmf: for each input $x$ that the
student sees, its goal is to output the same pmf vector as the teacher
outputs for $x$. The full algorithm is given in the diagram below.

![](./figures/transfer_learning/fig-transfer_learning-knowledge_distillation.png){width="100%"}


![Comparing knowledge distillation to supervised learning from labels.](./figures/transfer_learning/KD_diagram.png){width="100%" #fig-transfer_learning-KD_diagram}


:::{.column-margin}
This section describes knowledge distillation as it was defined in @hinton2015distilling, which is the paper that introduced the term. Note that the term is now often used to refer to the whole family of algorithms that have extended this original method. See @gou2021knowledge for a survey.
:::

Notice that this learning problem is very similar to softmax regression
on labeled data, and a diagram comparing the two is given in
@fig-transfer_learning-KD_diagram. The difference is that in knowledge
distillation the targets are not one-hot (like in standard label
prediction problems) but rather are more *graded*. The teacher outputs a
probability vector that reflect the teacher's belief as to the class of
the input, rather than the ground truth class of the input. These
beliefs may assign partial credit to classes that are similar to the
ground truth, and this can actually make the teacher *more* informative
than learning from ground truth labels.

Think of it this way: the ground truth label for a domestic cat is
"domestic cat" but the pmf vector output by a teacher, looking at a
domestic cat, is more like "this image looks 90 percent like a domestic
cat, but also 10 percent like a tiger." That would be rather informative
if the domestic cat in the image is a particularly large and fearsome
looking one. The student not only gets to learn that this image is
showing a domestic cat but also that this particular domestic cat is
tiger-like. That tells the student something about both the class
"domestic cat" and the class "tiger." In this way the teacher can
provide more information about the image than a one-hot label would, and
in some cases this extra information can accelerate student
learning @hinton2002training.

## Prompting

Prompting edits the *input data* to solve a new problem. Prompting is
very popular in natural language processing (NLP), where text-to-text
systems can have natural language prompts prepended to the string that
is input to the model. For example, a general-purpose language model can
be prompted with \[`Make sure to answer in French`, `X`\], for some
arbitrary input `X`. Then the output will be a French translation of
whatever the model would have responded to when queried with `X`.

The same can be done for vision systems. First, prompting methods from
NLP can be directly used for prompting the text inputs to
vision-language models @radford2021learning (@sec-VLMs-CLIP). Second, prompting can also be applied to
visual inputs. Just like we can prepend a textual input with text, we
can prepend a visual input with visual data, yielding a method that may
be called **visual
prompting** @bahng2022exploring, @bar2022visual, @jia2022visual. This
can be done by concatenating pixels, tokens, or other visual formats to
a vision model's inputs. This requires a model that takes variable-sized
inputs; luckily this includes most neural net architectures, such as
convolutional neural nets (CNNs), recurrent neural nets (RNNs), and
transformers. Or, we can combine the visual prompt with the input query
in other ways, such as by addition.

Prompting is visualized in @fig-transfer_learning-prompting, where
$\oplus$ represents concatenation, addition, or potentially other ways
of mixing prompts and input signals.

![Prompting: a prompt $\mathbf{p](./figures/transfer_learning/prompting.png){width="35%" #fig-transfer_learning-prompting}

Let's now look at several concrete ways of prompting a vision system.
One simple way is to directly edit the input pixels, and this approach
is shown in @fig-transfer_learning-pixel_prompt:

![A prompt can be made out of pixels: a prompt image (which looks like a border of noise here) is added to the input image in order to change the model's behavior. Three different prompts are shown, one that adapts the model to perform scene classification, a second for aesthetics classification, and a third for object classification. Modified from \cite{bahng2022exploring](./figures/transfer_learning/vp_hyojin.png){width="100%" #fig-transfer_learning-pixel_prompt}

Here, the prompt is an image $\mathbf{p}$ that is added to the input
image $\mathbf{x}$. The prompt looks like noise, but it is actually an
optimized signal that changes the model's behavior. The top prompt was
optimized to make the model predict the dog's species and the bottom
prompt was optimized to make the model predict the dog's expression.
Mathematically, this kind of prompting is very similar to the
adversarial noise we covered in @sec-bias_and_shift-adversarial_attacks.  


:::{.column-margin}
Because of its similarity to adversarial examples, early papers on prompting sometimes referred to it as *adversarial reprogramming* @elsayed2018adversarial.
:::

However, here we are not adding noise that *hurts* performance but instead adding
noise that *improves* performance on a new task of interest. Given a set
of $M$ training examples that we would like to adapt to,
$\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^M$, we learn a prompt via
the following optimization problem: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_{\mathbf{p}} \sum_{i=1}^M \mathcal{L}(f(\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + \mathbf{p}), \mathbf{y}^{(i)})
\end{aligned}$$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function for our
problem.[^1]

Rather than adding a prompt in pixel space, it is also possible to add a
prompt to an intermediate feature space. Let's look next at one way to
do this. Jia, Tang, *et al.* @jia2022visual proposed to use a *token* as
the prompt for a vision transformer architecture @dosovitskiy2020vit
(see chapter
@sec-transformers for details on transformers). This new
token is concatenated to the input of the transformer, which is a set of
tokens representing image patches
(@fig-transformers-prompting_a_transformer):



![Prompting a transformer with a learnable input token. The prompt token is mixed into the network via attention; therefore \textit{no} parameters of the original network have to be updated (see @sec-transformers).](./figures/transformers/prompting_a_transformer.png){width="100%" #fig-transformers-prompting_a_transformer}

The token is a $d$-dimensional code vector and this vector is optimized
to change the behavior of the transformer to achieve a desired result,
such as increased performance on a new dataset or task. The attention
mechanism works as usual except now all the input tokens also attend to
the prompt. The prompt thereby modulates the transformation applied to
the input tokens on the first layer, and this is how it affects the
transformer's behavior.

It is also possible to train a model to be *promptable*, so that at test
time it adapts better to user prompts. An advantage of this approach is
that we can train a model to understand human-interpretable prompts. For
example, we could train the model so that its behavior can be adapted
based on text instructions or based on user-drawn strokes (a
representative example of both of these use cases can be found in
@kirillov2023segment). In fact, we have already seen many such systems
in this book: any system that interactively adapts to user inputs can be
considered a promptable system. In particular, many promptable systems
use the tools of conditional generative modeling (chapter
@sec-conditional_generative_models to train systems can
are conditioned on user text instructions (e.g., @dalle1,
@rombach2022high, which we cover in chapter
@sec-VLMs-CLIP.

## Domain Adaptation

Often, the data we train on comes from a different distribution, or
domain, than the data we will encounter at test time. For example, maybe
we have trained a recognition system on internet photos and now we want
to deploy the system on a self-driving car. The imagery the car sees
looks very different than everyday photos you might find on the
internet. **Domain adaptation** refers to methods for adapting the
training domain to be more like the test domain, or vice versa. The
first option is to adapt the test data,
$\{\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{test}}^{(i)},\mathbf{y}_{\texttt{test}}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N$
to look more like the training data. Then $f$ should work well on both
the training data and the test data. Or we can go the other way around,
adapting the training data to look like the test data, *before* training
$f$ on the adapted training data. In either case, the trick is to make
the distribution of test and train data identical, so that a method that
works on one will work just as well on the other.

Commonly, we only have access to labels at training time, but may have
plentiful unlabeled inputs $\{\mathbf{x}^{\prime}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ at
testing time. This setting is sometimes referred to as **unsupervised
domain adaptation**. Here we cannot make use of test labels but we can
still align the test inputs to look like the training inputs (or vice
versa). One way to do so is to use a generative adversarial network
(GAN; chapter
@sec-generative_models that translates the data in one
domain to look identically distributed as the data in the other domain,
as has been explored in e.g.,
@tzeng2017adversarial, @CycleGAN2017, @hoffman2018cycada. A simple
version of this algorithm is given in algorithm
@fig-transfer_learning-domain_adaptation_by_translation.

![](./figures/transfer_learning/domain_adaptation_by_translation.png){width="100%" #fig-transfer_learning-domain_adaptation_by_translation}

:::{.column-margin}
You may notice that domain adaptation is very similar
to prompting. Both edit the model's inputs to make the model perform
better. However, while prompting's objective is to improve or steer
model performance, domain adaptation's objective is to make the inputs
look more familiar. This means domain adaptation is applicable even when
we don't have access to the model or even know what the task will
be.
:::



## Generative Data

Generative models (chapter
@sec-generative_models) produce synthetic data that
looks like real data. Could this ability be useful for transfer
learning? At first glance it may seem like the answer is no: Why use
fake data if you have access to the real thing?

However, **generative data** (i.e., synthetic data sampled from a
generative model) is not just a cheap copy of real data. It can be
*more* data, and it can be *better* data. It can be *more* data because
we can draw an unbounded number of samples from a generative model.
These samples are not just copies of the training datapoints but can
interpolate and remix the training data in novel ways (chapter
@sec-generative_models). Generative models can also
produce *better* data because the data comes coupled with a procedure
that generated it, and this procedure has structure that can be
exploited to understand and manipulate the data distribution.

One such structure is latent variables (chapter
@sec-generative_modeling_and_representation_learning).
Suppose you have generated a training set of outdoor images with a
latent variable generative model. You want to train an object classifier
on this data. You notice that the images never show a cow by a beach,
but you happen to live in northern California where the cows love to
hang out on the coastal bluffs. How can you adapt your training data to
be useful for detecting these particular cows? Easy: just edit the
latent variables of your model to make it produce images of cows on
beaches. If the model is pretrained to produce all kinds of images, it
may have the ability to generate cows on beaches with just a little
tweaking.

It is currently a popular area of research to use large, pretrained
generative models as data sources for many applications like
this @jahanian2021generative, @he2022synthetic, @brooks2022instructpix2pix.
In this usage, you are transferring knowledge about *data*, to
accelerate learning to solve a new problem. The function being learned
can be trained from scratch, but it is leveraging the generative model's
knowledge about what images look like and how the world works.

## Other Kinds of Knowledge that Can Be Transferred

This chapter has covered a few different kinds of knowledge that can be
pretrained and transferred. We have not aimed to be exhaustive. As an
exercise, you can try the following: (1) download the code for your
favorite learning algorithm, (2) pick a random line, (3) and figure out
how you can pretrain whatever is being computed on that line. Maybe you
picked the line that defines the loss function; that can be pretrained!
The term for this is a **learned loss** (e.g., @houthooft2018evolved).
Or maybe you picked the line `optim.SGD...` that defines the optimizer:
the optimizer can also be pretrained. This is called a **learned
optimizer** (e.g., @andrychowicz2016learning). It's currently less
common to *adapt* modules like these (they are usually just pretrained
and then held fixed), but in principle there is no reason why you can't.
Maybe you, reader, can figure out a good way to do so.

## A Combinatorial Catalog of Transfer Learning Methods {#sec-transfer_learning-combinatorial_catalog}

Many of the methods we introduced previously follow a similar format:

-   Pretrain one component of the system.

-   Adapt that component and/or other components.

In table
@tbl-generative_models-types_of_gen_model, we present the
relationship these methods by framing them all as empirical risk
minimization with different components optimized during pretraining
and/or during adaptation.

## Sequence Models from the Lens of Adaptation

There is one more important class of adaptation algorithms: any model of
a sequence that updates its behavior based on the items in the sequence
it has already seen. We can consider such models as *adapting* to the
earlier items in the sequence. CNNs, transformers, and RNNs all have
this ability, among many other models, because they can all process
sequences and model dependences between earlier items in the sequence
and later decisions. However, the ability of sequence models to handle
adaptation is clearest with RNNs, which we will focus on in this
section.

RNNs update their hidden states as they process a sequence of data.
These changes in hidden state change the behavior of the mapping from
input to output. Therefore, RNNs *adapt* as they process data. Now
consider that learning is the problem of adapting future behavior as a
function of past data. RNNs can be run on sequences of frames in a movie
or on sequences of pixels in an image. They can also be run on sequences
of training points in a training dataset! If you do that, then the RNN
is doing *learning*, and learning such an RNN can be considered
metalearning. For example, let's see how we can make an RNN do
supervised learning. Supervised learning is the problem of taking a set
of examples $\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)},\mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N$ and
inferring a function $f: \mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{y}$. Without
loss of generality, we can define an ordering over the input set, so the
learning problem is to take the sequence
$\{\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \mathbf{y}^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}^{(n)}, \mathbf{y}^{(n)}\}$
as input and produce $f$ as output.

The goal of supervised learning is that after training on the training
data, we should do well on any random test query. After processing the
training sequence
$\{\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \mathbf{y}^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}^{(n)}, \mathbf{y}^{(n)}\}$,
an RNN will have arrived at some setting of its hidden state. Now if we
feed the RNN a new query $\mathbf{x}^{(n+1)}$, the mapping it applies,
which produces an output $\mathbf{y}^{(n+1)}$, can be considered the
learned function $f$. This function is defined by the parameters of the
RNN along with its hidden state that was learned from the training
sequence. Since we can apply this $f$ to any arbitrary query
$\mathbf{x}^{(n+1)}$, what we have is a learned function that operates
just like a function learned by any other learning algorithm; it's just
that in this case the learning algorithm was an RNN.

Another name for this kind of learning, which is emergent in a sequence modeling problem, is **in-context learning**.

## Concluding Remarks

Transfer learning and adaptation are becoming increasingly important as
we move to ever bigger models that have been pretrained on ever bigger
datasets. Until we have a truly universal model, which can solve any
problem zero-shot, adaptation will remain an important topic of study.

[^1]: Here we require that the output space $\mathcal{Y}$ is the same
    between the pretrained model and the prompted model. If we want to
    adapt to perform a task with a different output dimensionality then
    we can add a learned projection layer $f^{\prime}$ after the
    pretrained $f$, just like we did in
    @fig-transfer_learning-finetuning_stages.
