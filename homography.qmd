# Homographies {#sec-homography}

## Introduction

In chapter
[\[chapter-geometry_homogeneous\]](#sec-geometry_homogeneous){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-geometry_homogeneous"} we discussed several types of
geometric transformations of two-dimensional (2D) images: translations,
rotations, skewing, scalings, and we saw that all could be modeled as
the product between the coordinates of a point in the input image
described using homogeneous coordinates and a $3 \times 3$ matrix. Now
that we have discussed camera models, we are well equipped to present a
more general geometric image transformation that opens the door to many
applications: the homography.

As we discussed in the previous chapter
[\[sec-stereo_vision\]](#chap:stereo_vision){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-stereo_vision"}, if we capture a scene with two cameras
from different viewpoints, corresponding points across both images are
constrained by the epipolar constrain. In general, there is not a simple
geometric transformation that maps pixels from one image into the pixels
of the other image. To find that mapping we will need to know the
three-dimensional (3D) location of each point as well as the relative
camera translation and rotation between both images.

However, there are a few scenarios where we can find a simple
transformation that allows warping one image into another image
corresponding to a new camera location without requiring knowing the 3D
scene structure: this will happen when the scene is planar (as in
@fig-illustration_homography) or when the two cameras are related just
by a rotation (@fig-rotation_homography). In those two cases the
coordinates of corresponding points across the two images are related by
a **homography**.

Homographies can be used in applications such as perspective correction,
augmented reality, image stitching, creating bird's-eye views,
correcting keystone distortions for projected images, and many others.

## Homography

Let's start with a formal definition of the homography. A homography (or
projective transformation) is a geometric transformation that preserves
straight lines. The homography is a function $h$ that maps points into
points, $\mathbf{p}' = h(\mathbf{p})$, with the property that if points
$\mathbf{p}_1$, $\mathbf{p}_2$, and $\mathbf{p}_3$ are colinear, then
the transformed points $h(\mathbf{p}_1)$, $h(\mathbf{p}_2)$, and
$h(\mathbf{p}_3)$ are also colinear. Such a function,
$\mathbf{p}' = h(\mathbf{p})$, can be written in homogeneous coordinates
as a product with a matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix}    x' \\
    y' \\
    w' 
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b & c \\
    d & e & f \\
    g & h & i
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1 
    \end{bmatrix}
    $${#eq-homography}

This can be written in the short form:
$$\mathbf{p}' = \mathbf{H} \mathbf{p}    $${#eq-homography_generic} where $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{p}'$
correspond to 2D points in homogeneous coordinates, and $\mathbf{H}$ is
a $3 \times 3$ matrix.

To prove that colinear points remain colinear after the homography we
can use the equation of a line in homogeneous coordinates,
$\boldsymbol{l}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{p}=0$. From equation
(@eq-homography_generic), we have that
$\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{H}^{-1} \mathbf{p}'$. Replacing the last equality
into the equation of the line gives
$(\mathbf{H} ^{-\mathsf{T}}\boldsymbol{l})^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{p'}=0$,
which corresponds to the equation of the line for the projected points
$\mathbf{p}'$.

In a general homography, angles and lengths are not preserved.
Therefore, parallel lines might not remain parallel, and lines of
identical length might have different lengths after a homography.
@fig-illustration_homography2 shows how a planar grid gets transformed
after applying a homography.

![](figures/homography/example_homography.png){width=".7"}

Let's start discussing in which scenarios the coordinates of points
between to images are related by a homography.

### Camera Rotation

Consider the following three images shown in @fig-example_three_images.

![](figures/homography/3_IMG_7883_small.jpg){width="44.5%"}
  ![](figures/homography/2_IMG_7884_small.jpg){width="25%"}
  ![](figures/homography/1_IMG_7885_small.jpg){width="25%"}

The three images are taken from the same point by rotating the camera.
There is no translation between the three camera positions as the
photographer took the three images by keeping the camera origin static
when moving the camera. Under this condition, the coordinates of the
corresponding points across each pair of images are related by a
homography independently of how far they are from the camera.

Here, we show that the mapping between feature point locations in two
cameras differing only in their 3D orientation, as shown in
@fig-rotation_homography, is a $3\times3$ matrix transformation of
their 2D positions written in homogeneous coordinates, that is, a
homography.

![](figures/homography/rotation_homography_vs3.png){width="100%"}

We start by setting the world coordinate system aligned with the
coordinate system of camera 1, as shown in @fig-rotation_homography.
Therefore, the projection of a 3D point,
$\mathbf{P}=[X,Y,Z]^\mathsf{T}$, into the camera 1 plane gives, setting
the translation vector to be zero: $$\lambda_1    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{K}  
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{I} & \mathbf{0} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    Z \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = 
    \mathbf{K} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    Z 
    \end{bmatrix} 
    $${#eq-projectionintofirstcamera}

We can now project the same 3D point into camera 2. Setting the
translation vector to be zero in equation (@eq-combinedexpandedsmaller),
and writing the $3\times3$ rotation matrices for camera 2 as
$\mathbf{R}$, we have for the observed position of a common 3D point
observed from camera 2:

$$\lambda_2    \begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{K} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{0} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    Z \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \mathbf{K}  \mathbf{R} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    Z
    \end{bmatrix}
    $${#eq-projectionintosecondcamera}

As both cameras see the same 3D point, $\mathbf{P}=[X,Y,Z]^\mathsf{T}$,
we can invert the two projection equations
(@eq-projectionintofirstcamera) and (@eq-projectionintosecondcamera) to
get the following relationship:

$$\begin{bmatrix}    X \\
    Y \\
    Z
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \lambda_1 \mathbf{K}^{-1}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \lambda_2 \mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{K}^{-1}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $${#eq-inverted_projectionintofirstcamera}

Using the last equality, we can establish the following relationship
between the corresponding image points, in homogeneous coordinates:

$$\lambda_2 / \lambda_1    \begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{K} \mathbf{R} \mathbf{K}^{-1} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $${#eq-homo3}

We can write the relationship between corresponding points as $$\lambda    \begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{H} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}$$ where $\mathbf{H}$ is a $3\times3$ matrix. Thus,
camera rotation modifies the locations of the image points by a
homography. The relationship also holds if the two cameras have
different intrinsic camera parameters. This concludes the proof.

Under certain conditions, a homography predicts the position of points
when viewed with another camera from another position. We just discussed
one condition, when the two cameras differ in their position by a
rotation about a common center of projection. We will now consider
another case.

### Planar Surface

A second case is when two cameras observe a 2D plane @Hartley2004. In
that case, the coordinates of corresponding points across the two camera
views, for points inside the plane, are related by a homography
(@fig-example_two_images_facade).

![](figures/homography/IMG_7127_crop.jpg){width="45%"}
  ![](figures/homography/IMG_7126.jpg){width="45%"}

To prove this, we can first show that the coordinates inside a plane
relate to the coordinates in the image plane by a homography
independently of relative position between the plane and the camera.
Therefore, the relationship between points across two images will also
be related by a homography.

We start by placing the world-coordinate system on the plane so that the
plane is defined by $Z=0$ as shown in the
@fig-homography_plane_geometry. Note that the origin can be placed at
any arbitrary location in the world.

![](figures/homography/homography_plane_geometry2.png){width="70%"}

The proof is similar to what we did in the previous section. We start
writing the projection equation $$\lambda 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{K}  
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{t} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    Z \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}$$

Note that we are not using the same notation for the translation vector
as we used in equation (@eq-extrinsic). You can obtain the same by
setting $\mathbf{t}= -\mathbf{R} \mathbf{T}$, where $\mathbf{R}$ and
$\mathbf{T}$ are the translation and rotation of the camera with respect
to the world-coordinate system. As we can put the world-coordinate
system in any arbitrary location, we chose the world-coordinates system
to be so that points in the plane have coordinates $Z=0$ as shown in
@fig-homography_plane_geometry. Therefore, we can write: $$\lambda 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{K}  
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{t} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    0 \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix} 
    =
    \mathbf{K}  
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{c}_1 & \mathbf{c}_2 &\mathbf{t} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_1 \\
    Y_1 \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}$$ Where $c_i$ is the column $i$ of the rotation matrix
$\mathbf{R}$. As the last expression contains the product of two
$3 \times 3$ matrices, we can write $$\lambda 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{H}  
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix} 
    $${#eq-projectionintofirstcamera} This last result shows that the
coordinates of points on the plane are related to the corresponding
points in the image plane by a homography.

As @eq-projectionintofirstcamera is true for any camera, the
relationship between corresponding points in the two cameras will also be related by a homography when the points correspond to points in a plane in the 3D space. 

:::{.column-margin}
A homography is a stronger constraint than the epipolar constraint between corresponding points across two camera views. However, the homography only applies under
certain conditions as we have seen, while the epipolar constraint always holds.

## Creating Image Panoramas

Let's now study a popular application of the homography: stitching
images to create large panoramas. To create a large panorama from
multiple pictures, the images need to be taken by a rotating camera
without translation.

To stitch together images, one needs to estimate the homography relating
the images to be stitched together. While one could estimate the
rotation and intrinsic camera matrices within equation (@eq-homo3) to
compute the homography, it is usually simpler to follow the procedure
below.

We will start assuming we have some initial correspondences between each
pair of images as shown in @fig-fig_matching_two_images. The
correspondences in this example are computer using **speeded up robust
features** (SURF) @Bay2008346.

![](figures/homography/fig_matching_two_images3.png){width="100%"}

### Direct Linear Transform Algorithm

Given a set of point locations, and their correspondences across the two
cameras, we can compute the homography relating the locations of imaged
points within the two cameras. To estimate the homography we can use the
direct linear transform (DLT) algorithm, as we did for the camera
calibration problem in section
[\[sec-camera_calibration\]](#sec:camera_calibration){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-camera_calibration"}. This will give us a linear set of
equations for the parameters of the homography matrix with the form:
$$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{0}$$ where $\mathbf{A}$ is a$2N \times 9$ matrix, when given $N$ corresponding pairs. The vector
$\mathbf{h}$ contains all the elements of the matrix $\mathbf{H}$
stacked as a column vector of length 9. Note that $\mathbf{h}$ only has
8 degrees of freedom as the results do not change for a global scaling
of all the values. Therefore we will need at least four correspondences
to estimate the homography between two sets of corresponding points, as
the ones shown in @fig-fig_matching_two_images. As before, the solution
is the vector that minimizes the residual
$\|\mathbf{A} \mathbf{h} \|^2$. The result is given by the eigenvector
of the matrix $\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{A}$ with the smallest
eigenvalue.

In practice, to get accurate results, it is useful to also minimize the
reprojection error after you initialize with the DLT solution since
$\|\mathbf{A} \mathbf{h} \|^2$ is meaningless geometrically.

### Robust Model Fitting: Random Sampling with Consensus {#sec-RANSAC}

To perform the image stitching in the section above, we had to find the
homography parameters that best described the transformation from one
image to another. Because the detection of the feature points can be
noisy, the homography fitting needs to be robust against inevitable
feature mismatches between images. A good algorithm to fit models to
data robustly is RANSAC @Fischler1981, which stands for **random
sampling with concensus**.

The procedure for RANSAC is simple, and the name contains most of the
steps of the algorithm. First, randomly select a sufficient set of
datapoints to fit the parameters of some model. The could be the
parameters that define a line, some other structure, or a homography.
Then, compute the model parameters from the randomly sampled set of
points. Compute the inliers in the dataset, that is, the datapoints that
fit the model (or achieve consensus) to within some tolerance. Repeat
that procedure some number of times, $N$. Compute a final model from the
set of inlier points corresponding to the largest number of inlier
datapoints.

@fig-ransac shows a simple instantiation of this algorithm for the case
of robustly fitting a straight line model to a collection of datapoints
(@fig-ransac\[a\]). First, a number of datapoints, sufficient to
uniquely specify the model parameters, are drawn from the dataset. For
this problem, that is two points. Two randomly selected points are
marked in green in @fig-ransacb. After finding the line that passes
through those two points, the number of **inliers** (datapoints within
$\epsilon$ of the model) are determined. For the line in @fig-ransacb,
the number of inliers is three. This process is repeated until some
desired number of samplings, $S$, have been drawn. The output model is
fitted from all the inlier datapoints corresponding to the model that
led to the most inlier datapoints.

![](figures/homography/ransac_algo.png){width="100%"}

The paper @Fischler1981 derives a heuristic for the number of samples,
$S$, required to be assured a good model fit. Let $n$ be the number of
datapoints required to specify the model, and let $w$ be (an estimate
of) the probability that any selected datapoint is within the error
tolerance of the model. For @fig-ransacf, there are $2$ outliers out of
11 points, so $w = 0.18$ (in general, this value needs to be estimated).
The $w^n$ is the probability that all the selected points are inliers,
and $1 -  w^n$ is the probability that at least one selected point is an
outlier. The probability that in $k$ trials only bad models are selected
is then $(1 -  w^n)^k$. If $p$ is the probability of selecting the
correct model, we have $$1-p = (1 -  w^n)^k$$ Taking the logarithm of
both sides lets us solve for $k$, the number of RANSAC iterations
required to find a good fit, with probability $p$:
$$k = \frac{\log(1-p)}{\log(1-w^n)}
        $${#eq-k} For the example of @fig-ransac, for 95 percent
accuracy,
$k = \frac{\log(-05)}{\log(1-0.18^2)} = \frac{-1.3}{-0.0143} = 91$ So
with 91 trials, we would have 95 percent confidence of finding the
correct model through RANSAC. Note that in practice you should select
points without replacement to avoid degenerate fits, but the previous
analysis assumed that points are selected with replacement. This is all
legitimate when the number of points selected is small relative to the
set of available points.

In the case of the homography estimation, we need eight equations to use
the DLT algorithm to estimate $\mathbf{H}$. As each point contributes
two equations, we need four corresponding points. We can sample multiple
randomly selected sets of four points and use RANSAC to estimate the
homography between two images.

### Image Stitching

Using DLT and RANSAC with can compute the homography between each pair
of images in figure and align them with respect to a reference image (in
this example we pick the middle image as a reference). We can use the
estimated homographies to warp all of the images into a single camera
view as shown in @fig-panorama.

![](figures/homography/panorama.jpg){width="100%"}

## Concluding Remarks

Homographies are an important class of geometric transforms between
images and they have lots of applications. Homographies can be used to
take measures on a plane given a reference measure. Although we have
focused on computing homographies between images using correspondences,
one can compute homographies in other ways. For instance, to produce a
bird's-eye view of a plane one can compute the needed homography using
the horizon line to get the camera rotation and, for an uncalibrated
camera, we can use vanishing points to get the intrinsic camera
parameters. The homography can also be extracted using a neural networks
trained to regress the homography given two input images
@abbas2019geometric.
