## Introduction

While pinhole cameras can form good images, they suffer from a serious
drawback: the images are very dim because not much light passes through
the small pinhole to the sensing plane of the pinhole camera. As shown
in @fig-pinholes and @fig-pinholeSize, one can try to let in more light by making
the pinhole aperture bigger. But that allows light from many different
positions to land on a given position at the sensor plane, resulting in
a bright but blurry image. Putting a lens in the larger aperture can
give the best of both worlds, capturing more light while redirecting the
light rays entering the camera so that each sensor plane position maps
to just one surface point, creating a focused image on the sensor plane.
Here we analyze how light passes through lenses under the approximation
of **geometric optics**, where we ignore effects like diffraction, due
to the wave nature of light.

![Brightness/sharpness trade-offs in image formation. From left to right
a small pinhole will create a sharp image, but lets in little light, so
the image may appear dark for a given exposure time. A larger pinhole
lets in more light and generates a brighter image, but each sensor
element records light from many different image positions, creating a
blurry image. A lens can collect light reflected over many different
angles from a single point, allowing a bright, sharp
image.](figures/imaging/apertures_and_lenses.png){#fig-pinholes

## Lensmaker's Formula {#sec-lensmaker}

In general, light changes both its wavelength and its speed as it passes
from one material to another. Those changes at the material interface
will cause the light to bend, an effect called **refraction**. The
amount of light bending depends on the change of speed of light within
each material, and the orientation of the light ray with respect to the
interface surface, according to **Snell's Law** @Hecht2016, given in the
equation below. Both the wavelength and the speed of light in a medium
are inversely proportional to the **index of refraction** of that
medium, denoted as $n$. The $n$ for a vacuum is 1. At a material
boundary, for the geometry illustrated in @fig-snell, we have
$$n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)$$ where $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ are the angles with respect to the surface normal of the
incident and outgoing light rays, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of
refraction of the materials in region 1 and region 2. Snell's law can be
derived by matching the wavelength of light projected along the material
interface boundary across each side of the boundary.

:::{.column-margin}
Snell's Law relates the bending angles of refraction, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, to the indices of refraction, $n_1$ and $n_2$, at a material interface.

:::


A lens is a specially shaped piece of transparent material, positioned
to focus light from a surface point onto a sensor. In an ideal world, a
lens focusing light from a surface onto a sensor plane has the property
that every light ray from the surface point that passes through the lens
is refracted onto a common position at the sensor, no matter what part
of the lens the ray from the surface hits. This dramatically increases
the light-gathering ability of the camera system, overcoming the poor
light-gathering properties of a pinhole camera system.

To achieve that property, we must find a surface shape that allows for
this focusing. Modern lens surfaces are designed by numerical
optimization methods, trading off engineering constraints to achieve the
best design, often involving several optical elements and different
materials. But to gain insight into the properties of lenses, we can
analytically design a lens surface shape provided we simplify the
optical system.

For small angles $\theta$ denoted in radians,
$\sin(\theta) \approx \theta$. If we also assume the index of refraction
of air is 1 (it is 1.0003) and denote the index of refraction of lens
glass as $n$, then Snell's law, as shown in @fig-snell, becomes
$$\theta_1 = n \theta_2,$$ for small bending angles $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$.

Consider a lens, and two points along its optical axis at a distance $a$
and $b$ from the lens, as shown in @fig-lens-a. We seek to find a surface shape for
a lens which creates the light paths shown in @fig-lens-a: light leaving from any
direction at point $a$ will be focused to arrive at point $b.$ @fig-lens-b shows a
view of @fig-lens-a, with angles and distances distorted for clarity of labeling.

:::


We make use of several approximations that commonly hold for imaging
systems: the deviations in angle from the optical axes are very small
(i.e., the *paraxial approximation*) and the lens is modeled to have
negligible thickness compared with other distances along the optical
axis (i.e., the *thin lens approximation*). Under those approximations,
we can write simple expressions for the bending angles shown in a @fig-lens-b a
function of $\theta_S$, the lens surface orientation at height $c$. Those relations are summarized below in table @tbl-lensmaker.

The middle row of table @tbl-lensmaker requires explanation. The light ray within
the lens, depicted in @fig-lens-b, is not necessarily parallel to the optical axis.
In general, it will be rotated by some angle $\delta$ away from the
optical axis, giving $\theta_S = \theta_2 + \delta$, and, at the other
lens surface, $\theta_S = \theta_3 - \delta$. Adding those two equations
removes $\delta$ and gives the relation
$2 \theta_s = \theta_2 + \theta_3$

| **Angle** | **Description** | **Relation** | **Reason** |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| $\theta_1$ | Initial angle from optical axis | $\theta_1 = c/a$ | Small angle approx. |
| $\theta_2$ | Angle of refracted ray wrt front surface normal | $n \theta_2 = \theta_1 + \theta_S$ | Snell's law, small angle approx. |
| $\theta_3$ | Angle of refracted ray wrt back surface normal | $2 \theta_S  = \theta_2 + \theta_3$ | Symmetry of lens, thin lens approx. |
| $\theta_4 + \theta_S$ | Angle of ray exiting lens wrt back surface normal | $n \theta_3 = \theta_4+\theta_S$ | Snell's law, small angle approx. |
| $\theta_4$ | Final angle from optical axis | $\theta_4 = c/b$ | Small angle approx. |
: Relations between angles of thin lens example, @fig-lens-b. {#tbl-lensmaker}


If we start from the relation in table @tbl-lensmaker for $\theta_4$, and substitute for each angle
using the relation in each line above, up through $\theta_1 = c/a$, we
can algebraically eliminate the angles $\theta_1$ through $\theta_4$ to
find the condition on the lens surface angle, $\theta_S$, as a function
of the distance $c$ from the optical axis, which allows for the desired
focusing to occur. The result is as follows:
$$\theta_S = \frac{c}{2(n-1)} \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \right)
$$ {#eq-ts1}

This relationship creates the effect that every ray
emanating at a small angle from point $a$ will be focused to point $b$. @eq-ts1 shows that the lens surface angle, $\theta_S$, must deviate from flat in
linear proportional to the distance $c$ from the center of the lens.

::: {.column-margin}
To focus, the lens surface angle, $\theta_S$, must be a *linear* function of the distance, $c$, from the center of the lens.
:::

In the thin lens approximation, both parabolic and spherical shapes
satisfy that constraint on the lens surface slope. For a spherical lens
surface, such as @fig-sphereLens, curving according to a radius $R$, we have
$\sin(\theta_S) = c/R$. For small angles $\theta_S$, this reduces to
$$\theta_S = \frac{c}{R},
$${#eq-ts2} where $R$ is the radius of the sphere, which has
the desired property that $\theta_S \propto c$.

![Relation between $R$ and $\theta_S$, in , for a spherical
lens.](figures/imaging/sphereLens3.png){#fig-sphereLens width="30%"}

Substituting into the focusing condition, yields the **Lensmaker's
Formula**, 

$$
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{f},
$${#eq-lensmaker} where the lens **focal length**, $f$ is defined to be 

$$f = \frac{R}{2(n-1)}$$

It is straightforward to show, by rotating the lens in @fig-lens-a through an angle $\theta_R$ in the above derivation, thus adding $\theta_R$ to $\theta_S$ in table @tbl-lensmaker, that the lensmaker's equation also holds for
light originating off the optical axis. Thus, under the paraxial and thin lens approximations, the lens focuses light from points on a plane onto points on a second plane, both perpendicular to the optical axis,
as illustrated in @fig-rotatedLens.

![Considering light from off-axis sources is equivalent to rotating the
lens surface by $\theta_R$, for small angles $\theta_R$. The lens
focuses rays from off-axis points like $P_1$, as well as from the
on-axis point, $P_0$.](figures/imaging/offAxis.png){#fig-rotatedLens width="100%"}

One can also generalize the equation for the case of a lens with
different radii of curvature, $R_1$ and $R_2$ on the front and back faces of the lens. Defining the left and right surface angles
$\theta_{s_1}$ and $\theta_{s_2}$, respectively, the middle row equation of table @tbl-lensmaker becomes
$\theta_{s_1} + \theta_{s_2} = \theta_2 + \theta_3$. Then, the equation substitutions of Table @tbl-lensmaker, combined with $\theta_{S_i} = c / R_i$, for
$i = 1$ and $2$, lead to
$$\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)$$

Note that some texts (e.g., @Hecht2016) adopt a sign convention where
the back surface of a lens is defined to have negative curvature.

@fig-greenLaser shows a demonstration of the focusing property for a thin lens. The
hand, labeled (a), is flicking a laser pointer back and forth, sending
light rays in many directions from a central point during the image
exposure, as would a diffuse surface reflection. All the light rays that
strike the lens, labeled (b), are focused to the same green spot,
labeled (c), while the light rays passing outside the lens at (b) reveal
their straight line trajectories on the wall at (c).

## Imaging with Lenses {#sec-imagingWithLenses}

Armed with the lensmaker's formula and the observation of @fig-thinLens, we can
analyze how rays travel through lenses in the approximation of
geometrical optics. Light passing through the center of a thin lens,
where the front and back surfaces are parallel, proceeds without
bending. Thus a convex thin lens images as a pinhole camera does, creating a perspective projection.

Light travels straight through the center of a thin lens, where front and back surfaces are parallel. (a) Lens with non-zero thickness. (b) Idealized thin lens. (c) Rays passing through the center of the lens behave like rays passing through a pinhole camera, and thus lenses impose a *perspective projection*.
:::

Two points on opposite sides of the lens at distances $a$ and $b$ from the lens that satisfy @eq-lensmaker are known as conjugate points. Light from one
conjugate point, traveling through the lens, focuses to the other
conjugate point, and vice versa (see @fig-lenspropt). The rules for tracing light
travel through a lens include the following:

1.  Every ray passing through one conjugate point and passing through
    the lens then passes through the conjugate point. This is the
    fundamental focusing property of a lens.

2.  Parallel rays entering the lens all focus to a point at distance $f$
    behind the lens, per @eq-lensmaker. In this case, one of the focal points is at
    infinity.

3.  Any ray passing through the center of the thin lens proceeds in a
    straight line, as if through a pinhole at the center of the lens
    (see @fig-thinLens). Thus, lenses, like pinholes, render the world in
    *perspective projection*.

4.  Because focused rays render positions onto a plane as does a line
    passing through the center of the lens, then the **magnification**
    of a lens is simply $a/b$, where $a$ is the distance of an infocus
    object to the lens, and $b$ is the distance from the lens to a
    sensor plane.

The above properties allow us to analyze the light paths through simple
configurations of lenses.

Referring to @fig-lenspropt, the two dots are at distance $f$ from the lens. In @fig-lenspropt-a,
parallel rays from infinity focus at a distance f from the lens. @fig-lenspropt-b to @fig-lenspropt-d show
that as a source of light rays moves closer to the lens, they focus
further away on the other side, while @fig-lenspropt-e shows how rays emanating from a
distance $f$ from the lens are parallel after the lens, that is, they
focus at infinity.

### Depth of Field

Assume that the lens is part of a camera, focusing light from the world onto the camera's sensor. If a plane outside of the camera, called the **focal plane**, and the camera's sensor plane are at conjugate positions, then an object in the focal plane is focussed sharply onto the sensor plane. All rays from a point on the object's surface will come into focus at a point in the sensor plane. This will image a point
in the focal plane to a **circle of confusion** at the sensor plane, as illustrated in @fig-circleOfConfusion.

![Circle of confusion and depth of field. Referring to @fig-rotatedLens, if the object
of interest and the camera's sensor plane are related as conjugate
points, that is, with distances $a$ and $b$ from the camera lens
respecting the lensmaker's formula (@eq-lensmaker), then the object will form an
image in sharp focus in the sensor plane. But objects in front of the
plane of focus by $\delta_a$ will, in general, come to focus some
distance $\delta_b$ behind the sensor plane
@Levoy2010.](figures/imaging/circleOfConfusion.png){#fig-circleOfConfusion
width="70%"}

Objects closer or further from the focal plane will come into focus
behind or in front of the sensor plane, respectively, resulting in a
blur circle at the sensor plane, as illustrated in
figures @fig-circleOfConfusion and @fig-DOFformula.

![Circle of confusion and depth of field. (Top) Variables used in the
computation of the depth of field of a lens. (Bottom) The elongation of
the depth of field size for a given tolerable circle of confusion
results from narrowing the lens aperture @Levoy2010. The catch is that
narrowing the aperture results in less light reaching the sensor
plane.](figures/imaging/dof.png){#fig-DOFformula}

The region around the plane of focus that results in a blur at the
sensor plane that is smaller than some tolerance is called the **depth
of field**. We can calculate the depth of field from geometric
considerations. This derivation follows that of Marc Levoy @Levoy2010.

A camera's **f-number**, written $N$, is the ratio of the focal length
of the lens divided by the diameter of the lens that light passes
through, called the aperture, A: $N = f/A$. Let the diameter of the
circle of confusion be $C$. If the distance, $U$, of the focal plane to
the camera is much larger than the focal length of the lens ($U >> f$)
then the diameter of the focal plane that is imaged onto the circle of
confusion is $C$ times the magnification of the imaging system, or
approximately $C U/f$, again, for $U >> f$. Referring to the top of @fig-circleOfConfusion, by
similar triangles, we have $$\frac{D_1 f}{C U} = 
    \frac{U - D_1}{\frac{f}{N}}$$ Also by similar triangles, we have
$$\frac{D_2 f}{C U} =
    \frac{D_2+U}{\frac{f}{N}}
    $$ Defining the depth of field, $D$, to be
$D = D_1 + D_2$, and combining terms, we have
$$D = \frac{2 N C U^2 f^2}{f^4 - N^2 C^2 U^2}$$ 

When the circle of
confusion, $C$, is much smaller than the lens aperture, $f/N$, then the
term $N^2 C^2 D^2$ can be ignored relative to $f^4$, and we have
$$D \approx \frac{2 N C U^2}{f^2}$$ Note that for smaller camera
f-numbers, $N$ (larger apertures), the depth of field decreases in
proportion. This effect can be seen in the bottom of @fig-DOFformula, and in @fig-rulers.

:::


### Concave Lenses

The lens we designed in @sec-lensmaker was convex. Also of interest are **concave**
lenses, with the lens surface curve bowing inward toward the center of
the lens. For example, consider the concave lens with the surface
orientation, $\theta_{Sx} = -\theta_S$ in @eq-lensmaker. By the reflection symmetry
of the lens surface angles, parallel rays entering a concave lens will
be bent away from the lens center by the same amount it would be bent
*toward* the center axis for a convex lens of the same lens radii of
curvature. This leads to a concave lens bringing parallel rays to a
virtual focus, a point from which the diverging rays leaving the lens
appear to be emanating. This is illustrated in @fig-ConcaveLenses-b on-axis, and @fig-ConcaveLenses-c for
off-axis parallel rays.

:::{#fig-ConcaveLenses layout-ncol=3}

Fig (a) A convex lens focuses rays to a point. (b) A concave
lens focuses rays to a virtual point. (c) As with convex lenses, a small shift in the angle of the incoming rays causes a shift in the focus point at the focal plane.
::: 

The mathematics of the ray bending is similar to that for convex lenses,
except the focal length of concave lenses has a negative value,
illustrated in @fig-ConcaveLenses. The focus point for a set of parallel rays entering a
concave lens from the left is also on the *left side* of the lens. It is
a *virtual focal point*, and from the right side of the lens, the
emanating rays appear to be originating from the point at distance $-f$
to the left of the lens.

### Lenses in a Telescope

The properties of convex and concave lenses can be used to make a
telescope, as Galileo did in the early 1600s @Galileo1610. We can see
how the telescope magnifies the size of objects from geometric
considerations. As shown in @fig-telescope-a, we position a convex lens, lens 1, with a
long focal length, $f_1$, and a concave lens, lens 2, with a shorter
focal length, $f_2$, such that each are $f_1$ and $f_2$ away from some
common point, respectively. Under those conditions, the configurations
of figures @fig-ConcaveLenses-a and @fig-ConcaveLenses-b will cause parallel rays from a distant object entering lens 1 to become a compressed set of parallel
rays leaving lens 2. Referring to @fig-telescope-b, an angular deviation of the input
rays of $\delta_i$ will become an angular deviation, exiting the convex
lens of $\delta_o$.

::: {#fig-telescope layout-ncol=1}

![](figures/imaging/telescope2.png){#fig-telescope-b}


Fig (a) Galilean telescope. The convex lens 1 and the concave lens 2 share the same focal point, marked with a dot, resulting in parallel rays in giving parallel rays out. (b) A small change in the input ray angle gives a larger change in the output ray angle. The magnification of the telescope is the ratio, $M$, of the angular deviation of an output ray, $\delta_o$, to the angular deviation of an input ray, $\delta_i$.  Writing the focal point offset, $d$, in terms of the rays passing through the centers of lenses 1 and 2 gives the relation, $M = f_1/f_2$, where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the respective ray focal lengths.
:::

By property 3 of @sec-imagingWithLenses, and the small angle approximation, we have
$\delta_i f_1 = d$, because the point $p$ is a distance $f_1$ from
lens 1. Similarly, we have $\delta_o f_2 = d$. Substituting for $d$
gives $$M = \frac{\delta_o}{\delta_i} = \frac{f_1}{f_2},$$ where we have
defined the telescope magnification, $M$, to be the amplification of the
parallel ray bending angles.

@fig-homemade shows a homemade telescope, inspired by Galileo's. The tube is a 2 in.
cardboard mailing tube, with a second tube inserted within it to allow
the interlens distance to be adjusted for focusing. The convex lens at
the front of the telescope has a focal length of 50 cm, and the convex
lens eyepiece has a focal length of 18 mm, giving a magnification of 27.
This is comparable to the 30x magnification of Galileo's telescope.

see that there was something different about its shape. These can all be
seen from just two lenses within a tube!

## Concluding Remarks

Pinhole cameras can allow more light to enter the camera aperture only
at the expense of image sharpness. Lenses overcome that tradeoff by
focusing all the rays passing through the lens from a point on a surface
to a single position on the sensor plane, creating an image that is both
sharp and bright.

Using small-angle and thin-lens approximations, we designed a lens
surface to have that focusing property, showing that the lens must have
a parabolic or spherical shape.

Geometric considerations allow depth-of-field calculations, as well as
the design of a simple telescope.
