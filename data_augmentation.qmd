# Training for Robustness and Generality {#sec-data_augmentation}

## Introduction

In the previous chapter, we saw that performance of a vision system can
look quite good on a training set but fail dramatically when deployed in
the real world, and the reason is often distribution shift. How can we
train models that are more robust to these kinds of shifts?

This chapter presents several strategies that all have the same goal:
broaden the training distribution so that the test data just looks like
more of the training data. The following sections present two ways of
doing this.

## Data Augmentation

augments a dataset by adding random transformations of each datapoint.
For example, below we show some common data augmentations applied to an
example image (@fig-data_augmentation-data_aug_examples):

Data augmentation might not seem not seem very
glamorous, but it is one of the most important tools at our disposal.
Machine learning is data-driven intelligence, and the bigger the data
the better. Data augmentation is like a philosopher's stone of machine
learning: it converts lead (small data) into gold (big
data).
:::

When you do this for every image in a dataset, you are essentially
mapping from a smaller dataset to a larger dataset. We know that more
data is usually better, so this is a way to simulate the effect of
adding more real data to your dataset.

![](./figures/data_augmentation/arrow.png){width="100%" #fig-data_augmentation-arrow}

The way data augmentation works is that for each
$\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}$ pair in your original dataset,
you add $M$ new synthetic pairs
$\{T(\mathbf{x}^{(i)};\theta^{(j)}), \mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{j=1}^M$, where
$T$ is a data transformation function with stochastic parameters
$\theta \sim p_{\theta}$. As an example, $T$ might be the `crop`
function, and then $\theta$ would be a set of coordinates specifying
where to apply the crop. We would randomly select different coordinates
for each of the $M$ crops we generate.

Notice that we did not apply any transformation to the
$\mathbf{y}^{(i)}$ values. The assumption we are making is that the
target outputs $\mathbf{y}$ are **invariant** to the augmentations of
the inputs $\mathbf{x}$. Let $y(\mathbf{x})$ be the true $\mathbf{y}$
for an input $\mathbf{x}$; then we are assuming that, $$\begin{aligned}    y(\mathbf{x}) = y(T(\mathbf{x},\theta)) \quad \forall \theta \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{$y$ invariant to $T$}
\end{aligned}$$ For example, if our task is scene classification then we
would want to only apply augmentations that do not affect the class
label of the scene. We could use mirror augmentation, since the
mirroring a scene does not change its class. In contrast, if the task
were optical character recognition, then mirror augmentation would not
be a good idea. That's because the mirror image of the character
[b]{.sans-serif} looks just like the character [d]{.sans-serif}.
Character recognition is not mirror invariant. In other words, for the
task of character recognition, we do not have that
$y(\texttt{mirror}(\mathbf{x})) = y(\mathbf{x})$. The same is true for
molecular data that exhibits so-called *chiral* structure: a molecule
may behave very differently from its mirror image.

To handle the case where $y(\mathbf{x}) \neq y(T(\mathbf{x},\theta))$,
we may use a more advanced kind of data augmentation, where we transform
the $\mathbf{y}$ values at the same time as we transform the
$\mathbf{x}$ values, using transforms $T_{\mathcal{X}}$ and
$T_{\mathcal{Y}}$. This results in an augmented dataset of the form
$\{T_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)};\theta^{(j)}), T_{\mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{y}^{(i)};\theta^{(j)})\}_{j=1}^M$.
For this to make sense, we require that $T_{\mathcal{X}}$ and
$T_{\mathcal{Y}}$ express an **equivariance** between the two domains,
which means, $$\begin{aligned}
     T_{\mathcal{Y}}(y(x),\theta_{\mathcal{Y}}) = y(T_{\mathcal{X}}(x,\theta_{\mathcal{X}})) \quad \forall \theta \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{$y$ equivariant with respect to $T_\mathcal{X}, T_\mathcal{Y}$}
\end{aligned}$$ This kind of data augmentation is standard in settings
where $\mathbf{y}$ has spatial or temporal structure that is aligned
with the structure in $\mathbf{x}$, like if $\mathbf{x}$ is an image and
$\mathbf{y}$ is a label map as in the problem of semantic segmentation.
Then, if we do random crop augmentation, we need to make sure to apply
the same crops to both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$:
$\{\texttt{crop}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)};\theta^{(j)}), \texttt{crop}(\mathbf{y}^{(i)};\theta^{(j)})\}_{j=1}^M$.

Sometimes our data is not sampled from a static *dataset* but instead is
generated by a simulator. In this setting we may apply an idea analogous
to data augmentation called . Here, rather than adding random
transformations to points in a dataset, we instead randomize the
parameters of the simulator, so that each interaction with the
simulation will look slightly different, for example, the lighting
conditions may be randomized. The effect is the same as with data
augmentation: you convert a narrow set of experiences (the simulation
with one kind of lighting condition) to a much broader set of
experiences to learn from (i.e., the simulation with many different
lighting conditions).

Why does data augmentation work? It *broadens* the distribution of
training data, and this can reduce the gap between the training data and
the test data. This effect is illustrated in
@fig-data_augmentation-data_aug_real_example. In this example, we have
training image from one dataset (Caltech256 @griffin2007caltech) and
test images from a different dataset (CIFAR100 @cifar100). The test
images look quite a bit different from the training data; they are lower
resolution and contain a different set of object categories. We say that
the test data are **out-of-distribution** relative to the training data.
Data augmentation adds variation to the training data, which broadens
the training distribution. The result is that the test data become more
in-distribution, compared to the training data. If we apply enough data
augmentation, then the test data will look just like more random samples
from the training distribution!

### Learned Data Augmentation

Simple transformations like mirror flipping or cropping can be very
effective while also being easy to implement by hand. After learning,
the model will be invariant (or sometimes equivariant, if the
$\mathbf{y}$ values are transformed too) with respect to these
transformations. But these are just a few of all possible
transformations that we might want to be invariant to. Imagine if we are
building a pedestrian detector. Then we would probably like it to be
invariant to pose variation in the pedestrian. This can be achieved by
augmenting our data with random pose variations. But to do so may be
very hard to code by hand. Instead we can use learning algorithms to
*learn* how to augment our data and achieve the invariances we would
like.

One way to do this is to use generative models. Latent variable
generative models like generative adversarial networks (GANs) or
variational autoencoders (VAEs) are especially suitable, because the
latent variables can be used to control different factors of variation
in the generated data (see @sec-generative_modeling_and_representation_learning).
Given a datapoint $\mathbf{x}$, an encoder
$f_{\phi}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}$, and a generator
$g_{\theta}: \mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$, we can create an
augmented copy of $\mathbf{x}$ as, $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{x} = g_{\theta}(f_{\psi}(\mathbf{x})+\mathbf{w}) \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{generative data augmentation via latent manipulation}
\end{aligned}$$ where $\mathbf{w}$ is a small perturbation to the latent
variable $\mathbf{z}$.  


:::{.column-margin}
GANs do not necessarily come with encoders $f_{\psi}$, but for applications that need one, like we have here, you can simply train an encoder via supervised learning on pairs $\{g_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}), \mathbf{z}\}$, solving $\arg\min_{\psi} \mathbb{E}_z [\mathcal{L}(f_{\psi}(g_{\theta}(\mathbf{z})), \mathbf{z})]$. See @donahue2016adversarial for discussion of this method and more advanced techniques.
:::

If we do this for a variety of
settings of $\mathbf{w}$, then we will get a set of output images that
are all slight variations of one another, just like we saw previously in
@fig-generative_modeling_and_representation_learning-biggan_latent_walk.
One simple approach is to just use Gaussian perturbations in latent
space, that is, $\mathbf{w} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ for some
perturbation scale given by $\sigma$. Algorithm
@fig-data_augmentation-generative_data_augmentation
formalizes this approach (see @chai2021ensembling for a representative
work that roughly follows this recipe, or @azizi2023synthetic for an
alternative approach to generative data augmentation).

![](./figures/data_augmentation/genaug.png){width="100%" #fig-data_augmentation-generative_data_augmentation}

There are some subtleties when working with learned data augmentation.
You might be tempted to train $g_{\theta}$ on the same dataset you are
trying to augment, that is, train $g_{\theta}$ on $X$, then use
$g_{\theta}$ to augment $X$. This can have interesting regularizing
effects, but it introduces an uncomfortable circularity, which can be
understood as follows. We want to create augmented data for training
some function $f$. Let the learner for $f$ be denoted as the function
$L$, which is a mapping from input data to output learned function $f$.

:::{.column-margin}
It can be confusing to think of a learning *algorithm* as a *function*, but that's what it is; as we pointed out in @sec-intro_to_learning, a learner is a function that outputs a function.
:::

Without data augmentation we have $f = L(X)$, and with data
augmentation we have $f = L(\tilde{X})$. But now, when $g_{\theta}$ is
trained on $X$, then $\tilde{X}$ is just a function of $X$; in
particular, if we use algorithm @fig-data_augmentation-generative_data_augmentation, it is
$\tilde{X} = \texttt{genaug}(X)$. So, we can define a new learner
$\tilde{L} = L \circ \texttt{genaug}$ where we have
$f = \tilde{L}(X) = L(\texttt{genaug}(X)) = L(\tilde{X})$. This
demonstrates that there exists a learning algorithm, $\tilde{L}$, that
uses unaugmented data and is just as good as our learning algorithm that
used augmented data.

A clearer gain can be achieved by using a $g_{\theta}$ pretrained on
external data. For example, if we have a general purpose image
generative model, trained on millions of images (such as
@ramesh2022hierarchical or @rombach2022high), then we can use it to
augment a small dataset for a new specific task we come across.

## Adversarial Training

With data augmentation, the learning problem looks like this:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_f \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}} [\mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim p_{\theta}}[\mathcal{L}(f(T(\mathbf{x};\theta)),\mathbf{y})]]
\end{aligned}$$ Here we are applying random transformations to the data,
and we want our learner to do well in expectation over these random
transformations. Instead of doing random transformations, we could
instead consider augmenting with *worst case* transformations, applying
those transformations that incur the highest loss possible for a given
training example: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_f \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}} [\max_{\theta \in \Theta}[\mathcal{L}(f(T(\mathbf{x};\theta)),\mathbf{y})]] 
\end{aligned}$${#eq-data_augmentation-adversarial_training} 

This idea is known as . One of its effects is that it
can increase the robustness of the learned function $f$ to perturbations
that may occur at test time (like those we saw in the previous chapter).

In the context of adversarial robustness, one form of
@eq-data_augmentation-adversarial_training is to set $T$ to be an
epsilon-ball attack, that is,
$T(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}+\mathbf{\epsilon}$: 
$$\begin{aligned}    \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_f \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}} [\max_{\mathbf{\epsilon} \, s.t. \left\lVert\mathbf{\epsilon}\right\rVert < r}[\mathcal{L}(f(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{\epsilon}),\mathbf{y})]]
\end{aligned}$${#eq-data_augmentation-eps_robust_training} 

This can increase robustness against the kinds of
epsilon-ball attacks we saw in the previous chapter.

Adversarial training has many other uses as well, beyond the scope of
the current chapter- it is used for training generative adversarial
networks (@sec-generative_models), for training agents to explore
in reinforcement learning @pathak2017curiosity, and for training agents
that compete against other agents @silver2016mastering. This general
approach is also known as **robust optimization** in the optimization
literature.

## Toward General-Purpose Vision Models

The lesson from this chapter is that if you train on more and more data,
you can achieve better coverage over all the test cases you might
encounter. This raises a natural question: Rather than inventing new
augmentation and robustness methods, why not just collect ever more
data? This approach is becoming increasingly dominant, and a major focus
of current efforts is on just scaling the training data size and
diversity.

### Multitask training

Because we have finite data for any given task, it can help to share
data between tasks. Suppose we have two tasks, $A$ and $B$. How can we
borrow data from task $B$ to increase the data available for task $A$?
In line with the theme of this chapter, one approach is to not just
broaden the *data* but to also broaden the *task*. The idea is to define
a new task, $AB$, for which tasks $A$ and $B$ are special cases. Then we
can train $AB$ on both the data for task $A$ and for task $B$. An
example of a metatask like $AB$ is data imputation (see @sec-generative_modeling_and_representation_learning).
One example of data imputation is to predict missing color channels;
this is the colorization problem, call this task $A$. Another data
imputation problem is predicting a chunk of pixels masked out of the
image; this is the inpainting problem, which we can call task $B$. We
can train a joint colorization--inpainting model if we simply set up
both as data imputation and train a general data imputation model. This
model can be trained on both colorization training data and inpainting
training data.

:::{.column-margin}
Data imputation is an incredibly
general framework. Can you think of other vision problems that can be
formulated as data imputation? Or, here is a harder question: Can you
think of any vision problems that cannot be formulated this
way?
:::



In the next chapter, we will see several more examples of how to make
use of data from task $B$ for task $A$.

## Concluding Remarks

A grand challenge of computer vision is to make algorithms that work in
*general*, no matter the setting in which you deploy them. For example,
we would like object detectors that will recognize a cat on the
internet, a cat in your house, a cat on Mars, an upside down cat, and so
on. One of the simplest ways to achieve this is to train for generality:
train your system on as much data, as diverse data, and as many tasks as
possible. This approach is, perhaps, the main reason we now have
computer vision systems that really work in practice, whereas a decade
ago we didn't.
