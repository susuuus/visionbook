# Transformers {#chapter-transformers}

## Introduction

**Transformers** are a recent family of architectures that generalize and expand the
ideas behind convolutional neural nets (CNNs). The term for this family
of architectures was coined by @vaswani2017attention, where they were
applied to language modeling. Our treatment in this chapter more closely
follows the **vision transformers** (**ViTs**) that were introduced in
@dosovitskiy2020vit.

Like CNNs, transformers factorize the signal processing problem into
stages that involve independent and identically processed chunks.
However, they also include layers that mix information across the
chunks, called **attention layers**, so that the full pipeline can model
dependencies between the chunks. 

## A Limitation of CNNs: Independence between Far Apart Patches

CNNs are built around the idea of *locality*: different local regions of
an image can safely be processed independently. This is what allows us
to use filters with small kernels. However, very often, there is global
information that needs to be shared across all receptive fields in an
image. Convolutional layers are not well-suited to *globalizing*
information since the only way they can do so is by either increasing
the kernel size of their filters or stacking layers to increase the
receptive field of neurons on deeper layers.
@fig-transformers-CNN_limitations shows the inability of a shallow CNN
to compare two input nodes ($x_1$ and $x_7$) that are spatially too far
apart:

![Consider a 2-layer CNN with kernel size 3, tasked to compare $x_1$ and $x_7$. It can't do it: there are no neurons that are connected to both $x_1$ and $x_7$. Hatch marks indicate which neurons are connected to $x_1$ and $x_7$ respectively.](figures/transformers/fig-transformers-CNN_limitations.png){#fig-transformers-CNN_limitations width="40%"}


How can we efficiently pass messages across large spatial distances? We
already have seen one option: just use a fully connected layer, so that
every output neuron after this layer takes input from every neuron on
the layer before. However, fully connected layers have a ton of
parameters ($N^2$ if their input and output are $N$-dimensional
vectors), and it can take an exorbitant amount of time and data to fit
all those parameters. Can we come up with a more efficient strategy?

## The Idea of Attention

Attention is a strategy for processing global information efficiently,
focusing just on the parts of the signal that are most salient to the
task at hand. The idea can be motivated by attention in human
perception. When we look at a scene, our eyes flick around and we attend
to certain elements that stand out, rather than taking in the whole
scene at once @wolfe2000visual. If we are asked a question about the
color of a car in the scene, we will move our eyes to look at the car,
rather than just staring passively. Can we give neural nets the same
ability?

In neural nets, attention follows the same intuitive idea. A set of
neurons on layer $l+1$ may *attend* to a set of neurons on layer $l$, in
order to decide what their response should be. If we "ask" that set of
neurons to report the color of any cars in the input image, then they
should direct their attention to the neurons on the previous layer that
represent the color of the car. We will soon see how this is done, in
full detail, but first we need to introduce a new data structure and a
new way of thinking about neural processing.

## A New Data Type: Tokens

We discussed that the main data structures in deep learning are
different kinds of groups of neurons: channels, tensors, batches, and so
on. Now we will introduce another fundamental data structure, . A token
is another kind of group of neurons, but there are particular ways we
will operate over tokens that are different from how we operated over
channels, batches, and the other groupings we saw before. Specifically,
we will think of tokens as *encapsulated* groups of information; we will
define operators over tokens, and these operators will be our only
interface for accessing and modifying the internal contents of tokens.
From a programming languages perspective, you can think of tokens as a
new data *type*.

In this chapter we will only consider tokens whose internal content is a
vector of neurons. A single token will therefore be represented by a
column vector $\mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 1}$, which is also
sometimes called the token's **code vector**.

### Tokenizing Data

The first step to working with tokens is to *tokenize* the raw input
data. Once we have done this, all subsequent layers will operate over
tokens, until the output layer, which will make some decision or
prediction as a function of the final set of tokens. How can we tokenize
an input image? Well, how did we "neuronize" an image for processing in
a vanilla neural net? We simply represented each *pixel* in the image
with a neuron (or three neurons, if it's a color image). To tokenize an
image, we may simply represent each *patch of pixels* in the image with
a token. The token vector is the vectorized patch (stacking the three
color channels one after the other), or a lower-dimensional projection
of the vectorized patch. With each patch represented by a token, the
full image corresponds to an array of tokens.
@fig-transformers-tokenization shows what it looks like to tokenize a
safari image in this way.

![Tokenization: converting an image to a set of vectors. $\mathbf{W}_{\texttt{tokenize}}$ is a learnable linear projection from the dimensionality of the vectorized crops to $d$ dimensions. This is just one of many possible ways to tokenize an image.](figures/transformers/fig-transformers-tokenization.png){#fig-transformers-tokenization width="70%"}


### Data Structures and Notation for Working with Tokens
:::{.column-margin}
As we will see, transformers are invariant to permutations of the input sequence, so, as far as transformers are concerned, groups of tokens should be thought of a \textit{sets} rather than ordered sequences.
:::

A sequence of tokens will be denoted by a matrix
$\mathbf{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$, in which each token in the
sequence, $\mathbf{t}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{t}_N$, is transposed to become
a row of the matrix: $$\mathbf{T} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{t}_1^\mathsf{T}\\
    \vdots \\
    \mathbf{t}_N^\mathsf{T}\\
  \end{bmatrix}$$ 

Graphically, $\mathbf{T}$ is constructed from
$\mathbf{t}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{t}_N$ like this
(@fig-transformers-T_notation):


![In this chapter, we will represent a set of tokens as a matrix whose rows are the token vectors.](figures/transformers/T_notation.png){#fig-transformers-T_notation}

The idea of this notation is that *tokens are to transformers as neurons
are to neural nets*. Neural net layers operate over arrays of neurons;
for example, an MLP takes as input a column vector $\mathbf{x}$, whose
rows are scalar neurons. Transformers operate over arrays of tokens. A
matrix $\mathbf{T}$ is just a convenient representation of 1D array of
vector-value tokens. 



:::{.column-margin}

Although we are only considering
vector-valued tokens in this chapter, it's easy to imagine tokens that
are any kind of structured group. We just need to define how basic
operators, like summation, operate over these groups (and, ideally, in a
differentiable manner).

:::

Transformers consist of two main operations over tokens: (1) *mixing*
tokens via a weighted sum, and (2) *modifying* each individual token via
a nonlinear transformation. These operations are analogous to the two
workhorses of regular neural nets: the linear layer and the pointwise
nonlinearity.

### Mixing Tokens

Once we have converted our data to tokens, we now need to define
operations for transforming these tokens and eventually making decisions
based on them. The first operation we will define is how to take a
*linear combination of tokens*.

A linear combination of tokens is not the same as a fully connected
layer in a neural net. Instead of taking a weighted sum of scalar
neurons, it takes a weighted sum of vector-valued tokens
(@fig-transformers:lin_bomb_neurons_vs_tokens):The general form of these equations for multiple input and output
neurons/tokens is: 

$$\begin{aligned}
    x_{\texttt{out}}[i]&= \sum_{j=1}^N w_{ij}x_{\texttt{in}}[j]\\ 
    \mathbf{x}_{\texttt{out}}&= \mathbf{W}\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{in}}&\quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \text{linear combination of neurons}\\
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}[i,:]&= \sum_{j=1}^N w_{ij} \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}[j,:]\\
     \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}&= \mathbf{W}\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}&\quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \text{linear combination of tokens}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers-lin_comb_tokens}

As can be seen above, operations over tokens can be defined just like
operations over neurons except that the tokens are vector-valued while
the neurons are scalar-valued. Most layers we have encountered in
previous chapters can be defined for tokens in an analogous way to how
they were defined for neurons.

For example, we can define a fully connected layer (fc layer) over
tokens as a mapping from $N_1$ input tokens to $N_2$ output tokens,
parameterized by a matrix $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_2 \times N_1}$
(and, optionally, by a set of token biases
$\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_2 \times d}$): 

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}&= \mathbf{W}\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}+ \mathbf{b} \quad\quad &\triangleleft \quad \text{fc layer over tokens}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers}

### Modifying Tokens {#sec-transformers:modifying_tokens}

Linear combinations only let us linearly mix and recombine tokens, and
stacking linear functions can only result in another linear function. In
standard neural nets, we ran into the same problem with fully-connected
and convolutional layers, which, on their own, are incapable of modeling
nonlinear functions. To get around this limitation, we added *pointwise
nonlinearities* to our neural nets. These are functions that apply a
nonlinear transformation to each neuron *individually*, independently
from all other neurons. Analogously, for networks of tokens we will
introduce *tokenwise* operators; these are functions that apply a
nonlinear transformation to each *token* individually, independently
from all other tokens. Given a nonlinear function
$F_{\theta}: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$, a tokenwise
nonlinearity layer, taking input $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$, can be
expressed as: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}= 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        F_{\theta}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}[0,:]) \\
        \vdots \\
        F_{\theta}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}[N-1,:]) \\
        \end{bmatrix}\quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{per-token nonlinearity}
\end{aligned}$$ Notice that this operation is generalization of the
pointwise nonlinearity in regular neural nets; a relu layer is the
special case where $F_{\theta} = \texttt{relu}$ and the layer operates
over a set of neuron inputs (scalars) rather than token inputs
(vectors): $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{x}_{\texttt{out}}= 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \texttt{relu}(x_{\texttt{in}}[0]) \\
        \vdots \\
        \texttt{relu}(x_{\texttt{in}}[N-1]) \\
        \end{bmatrix}\quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{per-neuron nonlinearity (\texttt{relu})}
\end{aligned}$$ The $F_{\theta}$ may be any nonlinear function but some
choices will work better than others. One popular choice is for
$F_{\theta}$ to be a multilayer perceptron (MLP); see Chapter
[Neural Nets](#chapter-neural_nets.html). In this case, $F_{\theta}$ has
learnable parameters $\theta$, which are the weights and biases of the
MLP. This reveals an important difference between pointwise operations
in regular neural nets and in token nets: relus, and most other
neuronwise nonlinearities, have no learnable parameters, whereas
$F_{\theta}$ typically does. This is one of the interesting things about
working with tokens, the pointwise operations become expressive and
parameter-rich.

## Token Nets
We will use the term **token nets** to refer to computation graphs that
use tokens as the primary nodes, rather than neurons.
:::{.column-margin}
Note that the terminology in this chapter is not standard. The term *token nets*, and some of the definitions we have given, are our own invention.
:::
Token nets are just like neural nets, alternating between layers that mix
nodes in linear combinations (e.g., fully connected linear layers,
convolutional layers, etc.) and layers that apply a pointwise
nonlinearity to each node (e.g., relus, per-token MLPs). Of course,
since tokens are simply groups of neurons, every token net is itself
also a neural net, just viewed differently---it is a net of subnets. In
@fig-transformers:neural_nets_vs_token_nets, we show a standard neural
net and a token net side by side, to emphasize the similarities in their
operations.

## The Attention Layer

**Attention layers** define a special kind of linear combination of
tokens. Rather than parameterizing the linear combination with a matrix
of free parameters $\mathbf{W}$, attention layers use a different
matrix, which we call the attention matrix $\mathbf{A}$. The important
difference between $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ is that $\mathbf{A}$ is
*data-dependent*, that is, the values of $\mathbf{A}$ are a function the
data input to the network. In addition, $\mathbf{A}$ typically only
contains non-negative values, consistent with thinking of it as a matrix
that allocates how much (non-negative) attention we pay to each input
token. In the diagram below (@fig-transformers:fc_vs_attn), we indicate
the data-dependency with the function labeled $f$, and we color the
attention matrix red to indicate that it is constructed from
*transformed data* rather than being free parameters (for which we use
the color blue):

The equation for an attention layer is the same as for a linear layer
except that the weights are a function of some other data (left
unspecified for now but we will see concrete examples subsequently):
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{A} &= f(\ldots) \quad\quad \triangleleft \text{ attention}\\
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}&= \mathbf{A}\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}
\end{aligned}$$

The key question, of course, is what exactly is $f$? What inputs does
$f$ depend on and what is $f$'s mathematical form? Before writing out
the exact equations, we will start with the intuition: $f$ is a function
that determines how much attention to apply to each token in
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$; because this layer is just a weighted
combination of tokens, $f$ is simply determining the weights in this
combination. The $f$ can depend on any number of input signals that tell
the net what to pay attention to.

As a concrete example, consider that we want to be able to ask questions
about different objects in our safari example image, such as how many
animals are in the photo. Then one strategy would be to attend to each
token that represents an animal's head, and then just count them up. The
$f$ would take as input the text query, and would produce as output
weights $\mathbf{A}$ that are high for the $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$
tokens that correspond to any animal's head and are low for all other
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$ tokens. If we train such a system to answer
questions about counting animals, then the token code vectors might
naturally end up encoding a feature that represents the number of animal
heads in their receptive field; after all, this would be a solution that
would solve our problem (it would minimize the loss and correctly answer
the question). Other solutions might be possible, but we will focus on
this intuitive solution, which we illustrate in
@fig-transformers-attention_layer_safari_query_cartoon.

What's neat here is that attention gives us a way to make the layer
dynamically change its behavior in response to different input
questions; asking different questions results in different answers, as
is visualized below in
@fig-transformers-attention_layer_safari_query_cartoon.

Let's walk through the logic of
@fig-transformers-attention_layer_safari_query_cartoon. Here we are
imagining a token representation that can answer two different kinds of
questions, one about number and the other about color. The
representation we have come up with (which learning could have arrived
at) is to encode in one dimension of the token vector a constant of
value $1$, which will be used for counting up the number of attended
tokens. In another set of dimensions we have the average RGB color of
the patch the token represents. Note that tokens only directly represent
image patches at the input to the network, right after the tokenization
step; at deeper layers of the network, the tokens may be more abstract
in what they represent. Each text query elicits a different allocation
of attention, and we will get to exactly how that process works later.
For now just consider that the text query assigns a scalar weight to
each token depending on how well that token's content matches the
query's content. The output token, $\mathbf{t}_{\texttt{out}}$, is the
sum of all the tokens weighted by the attention scalars. This scheme
will arrive at a reasonable answer to the questions if the text query
"How many animals are in this photo" gives attention weight $1$ to just
the tokens representing animal heads and the text query "What is the
color of the impala" gives weight $\frac{1}{3}$ just to the impala
tokens. Then the output vector in the former case contains the correct
answer $4$ in the dimension that represents number of attended tokens,
and contains the RGB values for brownish in the dimensions that
represent average patch color.

Keeping this intuitive picture in mind, we will now turn to the
equations that define the attention allocation function $f$. We will
focus on the particular version of $f$ that appears in transformers,
which is called **query-key-value attention**.

### Query-Key-Value Attention

Transformers use a particular kind of attention based on the idea of
queries, keys, and values. In query-key-value attention, each
token is associated with a **query** vector, a **key** vector, and a
**value** vector.

We define these vectors as linear transformations of the token's code
vector, projecting to query/key/value vectors of length $m$. For a token
$\mathbf{t}$, we have: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{q} &= \mathbf{W}_q \mathbf{t} \quad\quad \triangleleft \text{ query}\\
    \mathbf{k} &= \mathbf{W}_k \mathbf{t} \quad\quad \triangleleft \text{ key}\\
    \mathbf{v} &= \mathbf{W}_v \mathbf{t} \quad\quad \triangleleft \text{ value}
\end{aligned}$$ 



:::{.column-margin}

Here is a question to think about:
Could you use other differentiable functions to compute the query,
value, and key? Would that be useful?

:::

In transformers, all inputs to the net are tokenized, so the textual
question "How many animals are in the photo?" will also be represented
as a token.



:::{.column-margin}

We do not cover them in this book, but
methods from natural language processing can be used to transform text
into a token, or into a sequence of tokens.

:::



 This token will
submit its query vector, $\mathbf{q}_{\texttt{question}}$ to be matched
against the keys of the tokens that represent different patches in the
image; the similarity between the query and the key determines the
amount of attention weight the query will apply to the token with that
key. The most common measure of similarity between a query $\mathbf{q}$
and a key $\mathbf{k}$ is the dot product
$\mathbf{q}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{k}$. 

Querying each token in $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$ in this way gives us a vector of
similarities: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{s} = [s_1, \ldots, s_N]^\mathsf{T}&= [\mathbf{q}_{\texttt{question}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{k}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{q}_{\texttt{question}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{k}_N]^\mathsf{T}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers-attention_question_keys}

We then normalize the vector $\mathbf{s}$ using the softmax function to
give us our attention weights $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 1}$,
and finally, rather than applying $\mathbf{a}$ over token codes directly
(i.e., taking a weighted sum over tokens), we take a weighted sum over
token value vectors, to obtain $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{a} &= \texttt{softmax}(\mathbf{s})\\
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}&= \begin{bmatrix}
        a_1\mathbf{v}_1^\mathsf{T}\\
        \vdots \\
        a_N\mathbf{v}_N^\mathsf{T}\\
    \end{bmatrix} 
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers}

@fig-transformers-attn_arch1 visualizes these steps.

### Self-Attention

As we have now seen, attention is a general-purpose way of dynamically
pooling information in one set of tokens based on queries from a
different set of tokens. The next question we will consider is which
tokens should be doing the querying and which should we be matching
against? In the example from the last section, the answer was intuitive
because we had a textual question that was asking about content in a
visual image, so naturally the text gives the query and we match against
tokens that represent the image. But can we come up with a more generic
architecture where we don't have to hand design which tokens interact in
which ways?

**Self-attention** is just such an architecture. The idea is that on a
self-attention layer, *all* tokens submit queries, and for each of these
queries, we take a weighted sum over *all* tokens in that layer. If
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$ is a set of $N$ input tokens, then we have
$N$ queries, $N$ weighted sums, and $N$ output tokens to form
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}$. This is visualized below in
@fig-transformers-self_attn_layer.

To compute the query, key, and value for a set of input tokens,
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$, we apply the same linear transformations to
each token in the set, resulting in matrices
$\mathbf{Q}_{\texttt{in}}, \mathbf{K}_{\texttt{in}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times m}$
and $\mathbf{V}_{\texttt{in}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$, where each
row is the query/key/value for each token: 



:::{.column-margin}

Note that
the query and key vectors must have the same dimensionality, $m$,
because we take a dot product between them. Conversely, the value
vectors must match the dimensionality of the token code vectors, $d$,
because these are summed up to produce the new token code
vectors.

:::



 $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{Q}_{\texttt{in}}&= 
     \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{q}_1^\mathsf{T}\\
        \vdots \\
        \mathbf{q}_N^\mathsf{T}\\
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        (\mathbf{W}_q \mathbf{t}_1)^\mathsf{T}\\
        \vdots \\
        (\mathbf{W}_q \mathbf{t}_N)^\mathsf{T}\\
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}\mathbf{W}_q^\mathsf{T}&\triangleleft \quad\quad \text{query matrix} \\
    \mathbf{K}_{\texttt{in}}&= 
     \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{k}_1^\mathsf{T}\\
        \vdots \\
        \mathbf{k}_N^\mathsf{T}\\
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        (\mathbf{W}_k \mathbf{t}_1)^\mathsf{T}\\
        \vdots \\
        (\mathbf{W}_k \mathbf{t}_N)^\mathsf{T}\\
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}\mathbf{W}_k^\mathsf{T}&\triangleleft \quad\quad \text{key matrix}\\
    \mathbf{V}_{\texttt{in}}&= 
     \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{v}_1^\mathsf{T}\\
        \vdots \\
        \mathbf{v}_N^\mathsf{T}\\
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        (\mathbf{W}_v \mathbf{t}_1)^\mathsf{T}\\
        \vdots \\
        (\mathbf{W}_v \mathbf{t}_N)^\mathsf{T}\\
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}\mathbf{W}_v^\mathsf{T}&\triangleleft \quad\quad \text{value matrix}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers-query_matrix}

Finally, we have the attention equation: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{A} &= f(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}) = \texttt{softmax}\Big(\frac{\mathbf{Q}_{\texttt{in}}\mathbf{K}_{\texttt{in}}^\mathsf{T}}{\sqrt{m}}\Big) &\triangleleft \quad\quad \text{attention matrix}\\
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}&= \mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}_{\texttt{in}}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers}
where the softmax is taken within each row (i.e., over
the vector of matches for each separate query vector, like in
@eq-transformers-attention_question_keys). In expanded detail, here are
the full mechanics of a self-attention layer
(@fig-transformers-attn_arch):

This fully defines a self-attention layer, which is the kind of
attention layer used in transformers. Before we move on though, let's
think through the intuition of what self-attention might be doing.

Consider that we are processing the safari image, and our task is
semantic segmentation (label each patch with an object class). Figure
[\[fig:attention_layer_cartoon\]](#fig:attention_layer_cartoon){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:attention_layer_cartoon"} illustrates this scenario. We
start by tokenizing the image so that each patch is represented by a
token. Now we have a token, $\mathbf{t}_2$, that represents the patch of
pixels around the torso of the impala. We wish to update this token via
one layer of self-attention. Since the goal of the network is to
classify patches, it would make sense to update $\mathbf{t}_2$ to get a
better semantic representation of what's going on in that patch. One way
to do this would be to attend to the tokens representing other patches
of the impala, and use them to refine $\mathbf{t}_2$ into a more
abstracted token vector, capturing the label *impala*. The intuition is
that it's easier to recognize a patch given the context of other
relevant patches around it. The refinement operation is just to sum over
the token code vectors, which has the effect of reducing noise that is
not shared between the three attended impala patches, which amplifies
the commonality between them -- the label *impala*. More sophisticated
refinements could be achieved via multiple layers of self-attention.
Further, the impala patch query could also retrieve information from the
giraffe and zebra patches, as those patches provide additional context
that could be informative (the animal in the query is more likely to be
an impala if it is found near giraffes and zebras, since all those
animals tend to congregate together in the same biome).

This is just one way self-attention could be used by the network. How it
is actually used will be determined by the training data and task. What
really happens might deviate from our intuitive story: tokens on hidden
layers do not necessarily represent spatially localized patches of
pixels. While the initial tokenization layer creates tokens out of local
image patches, after this point attention layers can mix information
across spatially distant tokens; note that
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}[0,:]$ does not necessarily represent the same
spatial region in the image as $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}[0,:]$.

@fig-transformers:transformers_attn_ex gives an example of what
self-attention maps can look like on the safari image. In this example,
we are simply using patch color as the query and key features. Each
attention map shows one row of $\mathbf{A}$ reshaped into the size of
the input image.

### Multihead Self-Attention

Despite their power, self-attention layers are still limited in that
they only have one set of query/key/value projection matrices (namely,
$\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, $\mathbf{W}_v$). These matrices define
the notion of similarity that is used to match queries to keys. In
particular, the similarity between two tokens $i$ and $j$ is measured
as: $$\begin{aligned}
     s_{ij} &= \mathbf{q}_i^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{k}_j\\
     &= (\mathbf{W}_q \mathbf{t}_i)^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{W}_k \mathbf{t}_j\\
     &= \mathbf{t}_i^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{W}_q^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{W}_k \mathbf{t}_j\\
     &= \mathbf{t}_i^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{S}\mathbf{t}_j
\end{aligned}$$ What this shows is that $\mathbf{W}_q$ and
$\mathbf{W}_k$ define some matrix
$\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{W}_q^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{W}_k$ that modulates how we
measure similarity (dot product) between $\mathbf{t}_i$ and
$\mathbf{t}_j$. A single self-attention layer therefore measures
similarity in just one way.

What if we want to measure similarity in more than one way? For example,
maybe we want our net to perform some set of computations based on color
similarity, another based on texture similarity, and yet another based
on shape similarity? The way transformers can do this is with
**multihead self-attention** (**MSA**). This method simply consists of
running $k$ attention layers in parallel. All these layers are applied
to the same input $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$. This results in $k$ output
sets of tokens,
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}^1, \ldots, \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}^k$. To
merge these outputs, we concatenate all of them and project back to the
original dimensionality of $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$. These steps are
shown in the math below: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}^i &= \texttt{attn}^i(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}) \quad \text{for } i \in \{1,\ldots,k\}\\
    \bar{\mathbf{T}}_{\texttt{out}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}^1[0,:] & \ldots & \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}^k[0,:]\\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}^1[N-1,:] & \ldots & \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}^k[N-1,:]\\
    \end{bmatrix} &\quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \bar{\mathbf{T}}_{\texttt{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times kv}\\
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}&= \bar{\mathbf{T}}_{\texttt{out}}\mathbf{W}_{\texttt{MSA}} &\quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \mathbf{W}_{\texttt{MSA}} \in \mathbb{R}^{kv \times d} :MSA_merge
\end{aligned}$${} where $v$ is the dimensionality of the value vectors and
$d$ is the dimensionality of the code vectors of the output
(@dosovitskiy2020vit recommends setting $kv = d$). The matrix
$\mathbf{W}_{\texttt{MSA}}$ *merges* all the heads; its values are
learnable parameters. The other learnable parameters of MSA are the
query, key, and value projections for each of the $k$ attention heads.

:::{.column-margin}

Notice that here, unlike in the single-headed
self-attention layers presented previously, the value vectors need not
have the same dimensionality as the token code vectors, since we are
applying the projection @eq-transformers:MSA_merge.

:::





The basic reasoning here is quite simple: if self-attention layers are a
good thing, why not just add more of them? We can add more *sequential*
self-attention layers by building deeper transformers, or we can add
more *parallel* self-attention layers by using MSA.

## The Full Transformer Architecture {#sec-transformers:ViT_arch}

A full transformer architecture is a stack of self-attention layers
interleaved with tokenwise nonlinearities. These two steps are analogous
to linear layers interleaved with neuronwise nonlinearities in an MLP,
as shown below (@fig-transformers:transformer_vs_MLP):

Beyond this basic template, there are many variations that can be added,
resulting in different particular architectures within the transformer
family. Some common additions are normalization layers and residual
connections. In @fig-transformers:ViT_arch we plot the ViT architecture
from @dosovitskiy2020vit, showing where these additional pieces enter
the picture.

This architecture uses layer normalization (section
[\[sec-neural_nets:normalization_layers\]](#sec-neural_nets:normalization_layers){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-neural_nets:normalization_layers"}) before each attention
layer and before each token-wise MLP layer. The normalization is done
*within* each token (the token code vector is treated as a akin to a
layer; each dimension of this vector is standardized by the mean and
variance over all dimensions of this vector), so in we refer to this
layer as `token norm`. Notice that `token norm` is a tokenwise
operation, just like our tokenwise MLP, but it performs a different kind
of transformation and does not have learnable parameters. Residual
connections are added around each group of layers.

Pseudocode for this a ViT (with single-headed attention) is given below:

``` {.python xleftmargin="0.0" xrightmargin="0.0" fontsize="\\fontsize{8.5}{9}" frame="single" framesep="2.5pt" baselinestretch="1.05"}
# x : input data (RGB image)
# K : tokenization patch size
# d : token/query/key/value dimensionality (setting these all as the same)
# L : number of layers
# W_q_T, W_k_T, W_v_T : transposed query/key/value projection matrices
# mlp: tokenwise mlps

# tokenize input image
T = tokenize(x,K) # 3 x H x W image --> N x d array of token code vectors

# run tokens through all L layers
for l in range(L):

    # attention layer
    Q, K, V = nn.matmul(nn.layernorm(T),[W_q_T[l], W_k_T[l], W_v_T[l]]) 
    # nn.matmul does matrix multiplication
    A = nn.softmax(nn.matmul(Q,K.transpose()), dim=0)/sqrt(d)
    T = nn.matmul(A,V) + T # note residual connection

    # tokenwise mlp
    T = mlp[l](nn.layernorm(T)) + T # note residual connection

# T now contains the output token representation computed by the transformer
```

The output of a transformer, as we have so far defined it, is a set of
tokens $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}$. Often we want an output of a
different format, such as a single vector of logits for image
classification (section
[\[sec-intro_to_learning:image_classification\]](#sec-intro_to_learning:image_classification){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-intro_to_learning:image_classification"}), or in the
format of an image for image-to-image tasks (section
[\[sec-conditional_generative_models:im2im\]](#sec-conditional_generative_models:im2im){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-conditional_generative_models:im2im"}). To handle these
cases, we typically define a task-specific output layer that takes
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}$ as input and produces the desired format as
output. For example, to produce a vector of logit predictions we could
first sum all the token code vectors in $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}$ and
then, using a single linear layer, project the resulting $d$-dimensional
vector into a $K$-dimensional vector (for $K$-way classification).

## Permutation Equivariance

An important property of transformers is that they are equivariant to
permutations of the input token sequence. This follows from the fact
that both tokenwise layers, $F_{\theta}$, and attention layers,
$\texttt{attn}$, are **permutation equivariant**: $$\begin{aligned}
    F_{\theta}(\texttt{permute}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}})) &= \texttt{permute}(F_{\theta}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}))\\
    \texttt{attn}(\texttt{permute}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}})) &= \texttt{permute}(\texttt{attn}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}))
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers} where $\texttt{permute}$ is a permutation of the order
of tokens in $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$ (i.e., permutes the rows of the
matrix). This means that if you scramble (i.e. permute) the patches in
the input image then apply attention, the output will be unchanged up to
a permutation of the original output. Since the full transformer
architecture is just composition of these two types of layers (plus,
potentially, residual connections and token normalization, which are
also permutation equivariant), and because composing two permutation
equivariant functions results in a permutation equivariant operation, we
have: $$\begin{aligned}
    \texttt{transformer}(\texttt{permute}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}})) &= \texttt{permute}(\texttt{transformer}(\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}))
\end{aligned}$$ This property is visualized in
@fig-transformers-permutation_equivariance.

It is often useful to understand layers in terms of their invariances
and equivariances. Convolutational layers are translation equivariant
but not necessarily permutation equivariant whereas attention layers are
both translation equivariant *and* permutation equivariant (since
translation is a special kind of permutation, any permutation
equivariant layer is also translation equivariant). Other layers can be
catalogued similarly: global average pooling layers are permutation
*invariant*, relu layers are permutation equivariant, per-token MLP
layers are also permutation equivariant (but with respect to sets of
tokens rather than sets of neurons), and so on.

A generally good strategy is to select layers that reflect the
symmetries in your data or task: in object detection, translation
equivariance makes sense because, roughly, a bird is a bird no matter
where it appears in an image. Permutation equivariance might also make
sense, for that same reason, but only to an extent: if you break up an
image into small patches and scramble them, this could disrupt spatial
layout that is important for recognition. We will see in section
[1.11](#sec-transformers:positional_encodings){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-transformers:positional_encodings"} how transformers use
something called positional codes to reinsert useful information about
spatial layout.

## CNNs in Disguise

Transformers provide a new way of thinking about data processing, and it
may seem like they are very different from past architectures. However,
as we have alluded to, they actually have many commonalities with CNNs.
In fact, most (but not all) of the transformer architecture can be
viewed as a CNN in disguise. In this section we will walk through
several of the layers we learned about above, and see how they are in
fact performing convolutions.

### Tokenization

The first step in working with transformers is to tokenize the input.
The most basic way to do this is to chop up the input image into
non-overlapping patches of size $K \times K$, then convert these patches
to vectors via a linear projection. You might already have noticed that
this operation can be written as convolution; after all we said the
whole idea of CNNs is to chop the signal into patches. In particular,
this form of tokenization can be written as a convolutional layer with
kernel size and stride both equal to $K$: 
$$\begin{aligned}
&\mathbf{T}[n(N/K)+m,c_{\texttt{2}}] = \nonumber\\
&b[c_{\texttt{2}}] +  \sum_{c_{\texttt{1}}=1}^{C_{\texttt{in}}} \sum_{k_1,k_2=-K}^K w[c_{\texttt{1}},c_{\texttt{2}},k_1,k_2] x_{\texttt{in}}[c_{\texttt{1}},K n-k_1,K m-k_2] \quad \triangleleft \quad \text{(tokenization)}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-tokenization_as_conv} 

where, for RGB images, $\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{in}}\in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times N \times M}$,
$C_{\texttt{in}}=3$, and $C_{\texttt{out}}=d$ (the token
dimensionality). This math assumes $N$ and $M$ are evenly divisible by
$K$; if they aren't then the input can be resized or padded until they
are.

Although the equation starts to look complicated, it is just a
$\texttt{conv}$ operator with the following parameters:

``` {.python}
T = conv(x_in, channels_in=3, channels_out=d, kernel=K, stride=K) # tokenize
```

### Query-Key-Value Projections

Next let's look at the query, key, and value projections that are part
of the attention layers. For simplicity, we will consider just the query
projection, since key and value follow exactly the same pattern.

We wrote this operation as a matrix multiply
$\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}\mathbf{W}_q^\mathsf{T}$
(@eq-transformers-query_matrix). What this multiply is doing is applying
the same linear transformation ($\mathbf{W}_q$) to each token vector
(each row of $\mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}$). Applying the same linear
operation to each element in a sequence is exactly what convolution
does. Specifically, the query operation can be written as convolving the
set of $N$ $d$-channel tokens with a filter bank of $m$ filters, with
kernel size 1, producing a new set of $N$ $m$-channel tokens. This
equivalence is visualized below
(@fig-transformers-conv_matmul_equivalence):

Therefore, the query, key, and value projections are all multichannel
convolutions with kernels of size 1.

### Tokenwise MLP

Next we will consider the token-wise MLP layer. A token-wise MLP applies
the same MLP $F_{\theta}$ to each token in a sequence. The $F_{\theta}$
consists of linear layers and pointwise nonlinearities. For simplicity,
we will assume no biases (as an exercise, this can be relaxed). The
linear layers in $F_{\theta}$ all have the following form:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{t}_{\texttt{out}} &= \mathbf{W}\mathbf{t}_{\texttt{in}}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers} When we apply such a layer to each token in the
sequence, we have: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{out}}&= \mathbf{T}_{\texttt{in}}\mathbf{W}^{\mathsf{T}}
\end{aligned}$$ Notice that this looks just like the query operation we
covered in the previous section, @eq-transformers-query_matrix.
Therefore, the same result holds: the linear layers of the token-wise
MLP can all be written as convolutions with kernel size 1.

Now the pointwise nonlinearities in the MLP are applied neuronwise, so
these layers function identically to the pointwise nonlinearity in CNNs.
This is the full set of layers in the MLP, and therefore we have that a
token-wise MLP can be written as a series of convolutions interleaved
with neuronwise-nonlinearities, i.e. a CNN.

### The Similarities between CNNs and Transfomers

As we have now seen, most layers in transformers are convolutional.
These layers break up the signal processing problem into chunks, then
process each chunk independently and identically. Some of the
other operations in transformers -- normalization layers, residual
connections, etc -- are also common in CNNs. So what is *different*
between transformers and CNNs?

### The Differences between CNNs and Transformers

#### CNNs can have kernels with non-unitary spatial extent

When we wrote them as convolutions, the query-key-value projections and
token-wise MLPs *only used 1x1 filters*.

:::{.column-margin}

We use the
term "1x1 filter" to refer to any filter whose kernel size is 1 in all
its dimensions, regardless of whether the signal is one-dimensional,
two-dimensional, three-dimensional, etc.

:::



In fact it cannot be otherwise. If you used larger kernel it would break the permutation
invariance property of transformers, since the output of the filters
would depend on which token is next to which. This is one of the key
differences between CNNs and transformers. CNNs use $K \times K$
filters, and this makes it so adjacent image regions get processed
together. Transformers use 1x1 filters which means the network has no
architectural way of knowing about spatial structure (which token is
next to which). For vision problems, where spatial structure is often
crucially important, transformers can instead be given knowledge of
position through the *inputs* to the network, rather than through the
architectural structure. We will cover this idea in section [Positional Encodings](#sec-transformers-positional_encodings)

#### Transformers have attention layers

Attention layers are *not* convolutional. They do not factor the
processing into independent chunks but instead perform a global
operation, in which all input tokens can interact. The linear
combination of tokens that results is not a mixing operation found in
CNNs and addresses the limitation of CNNs being myopic, with each filter
only seeing information in its receptive field.

## Masked Attention {#sec-transformers:masked_attention}

Sometimes we want to restrict which tokens can attend to which. This can
be done by *masking* the attention matrix, which just means fixing some
of the weights to be zero. This can be useful for many settings,
including learning features via masked autoencoding @he2022masked,
cross-attention between different data modalities @wei2020multi, and for
sequential prediction @chen2020generative. To illustrate, we will
describe the sequential prediction use case. 

A common problem is to predict the $(n+1)$-th token in a sequence given
the previous $n$ tokens. For example, we may be trying to predict tokens
that represent the next frame in a video, the next word in a sentence,
or the weather on the next day.

A simple way to model this prediction problem is with a linear layer:
$\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{T}_{1:n}$. Here is what
this looks like diagrammatically, and on the right is the layer shown as
matrix multiplication:

During training, we will give examples like this: $$\begin{aligned}
    \{\mathbf{t}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{t}_n\} &\rightarrow \mathbf{t}_{n+1}\\
    \{\mathbf{t}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{t}_{n-1}\} &\rightarrow \mathbf{t}_n\\
    \{\mathbf{t}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{t}_{n-2}\} &\rightarrow \mathbf{t}_{n-1}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers-causal_training_batches} and so on. We can make all these predictions at once
with a single matrix multiply
(@fig-transformers-masked_attn_one_matmul):

This way, one forward pass makes $N$ predictions rather than one
prediction. This is equivalent to doing a single next token prediction
$N$ times, but it all happens in a single matrix multiply, using the
matrix shown on the right.

This kind of matrix is called *causal* because each output index $i$
only depends on input indices $j$ such that $j < i$. If $\mathbf{A}$ is
an attention matrix, then this strategy is called **causal attention**.
This is a masking strategy where each token can only attend to
*previous* tokens in the sequence. This approach can dramatically speed
up training because all the sub-sequence prediction problems (predict
$\mathbf{t}_{n-1}$ given $\mathbf{T}_{1:n-2}$, predict $\mathbf{t}_{n}$
given $\mathbf{T}_{1:n-1}$, predict $\mathbf{t}_{n+1}$ given
$\mathbf{T}_{1:n}$) are supervised at the same time.

This also works for transformers with more than one layer, where the
masking strategy looks like shown in
@fig-transformers:multilayer_masked_attention.

Notice that the output tokens on every layer $l$ have the property that
$\mathbf{t}^l_n$ only depends on $\mathbf{T}^0_{1:n-1}$, where
$\mathbf{T}^0$ are the initial set of tokens input into the transformer.
Also notice that, after the first layer, all subsequent layers can use
causal attention that is not shifted in time, and the previous property
is still maintained. Finally, notice that the subnetwork that predicts
each subsequent output token overlaps substantially with the subnetworks
that predict each previous token. That is, there is sharing of
computation between all the prediction problems. We will see a more
concrete application of this strategy when we get to autoregressive
models in section
[\[sec-generative_models:autoregressive\]](#sec-generative_models:autoregressive){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-generative_models:autoregressive"}.

## Positional Encodings {#sec-transformers:positional_encodings}

Another idea associated with transformers is . Operations over tokens in
a transformer are permutation equivariant, which means that we can
shuffle the positions of the tokens and nothing substantial changes (the
only change is that the outputs get permuted). A consequence is that
tokens do not know encode their position within the representation of
the signal. Sometimes, however, we may wish to retain
positional knowledge. For example, knowing that a token is a
representation of the top region of an image can help us identify that
the token is likely to represent sky. Positional encoding concatenates a
code representing *position within the signal* onto each token. If the
signal is an image, then the positional code should represent the x- and
y-coordinates. However, it need not represent these coordinates as
scalars; more commonly we use a periodic representation of position,
where the coordinates are encoded as the vector of values a set of
sinusoidal waves take on at each position: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{p}_x &= [\sin(x), \sin(x/B), \sin(x/B^2), \ldots, \sin(x/B^P)]^\mathsf{T}\\
    \mathbf{p}_y &= [\sin(y), \sin(y/B), \sin(y/B^2), \ldots, \sin(y/B^P)]^\mathsf{T}\\
    \mathbf{p} &= \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{p}_x\\
        \mathbf{p}_y
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-transformers} where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the token. This
representation is visualized in @fig-transformers:positional_codes:

Another strategy is to simply let the positional codes be *learned* by
the model, which could potentially result in a better representation of
space than sinusoidal codes @dosovitskiy2020vit.

While positional encoding is useful and common in transformers, it is
not specific to this architecture. The same kind of encodings can be
useful for CNNs as well, as a way to make convolutional filters that are
conditioned on position, thereby applying a different weighted sum at
each location in the image @liu2018intriguing. Positional encodings also
appear in radiance fields, which we cover in chapter
[\[chapter-nerfs\]](#chapter-nerfs){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-nerfs"}.

## Comparing Fully Connected, Convolutional, and Self-Attention Layers





:::{.column-margin}

The shorthand "fc" is often used to indicate a
fully-connected linear layer.

:::



 Many layers in deep nets are special
kinds of affine transformations. Three we have seen so far are
fully-connected layers (`fc`), convolutional layers (`conv`), and
self-attention layers (`attn`). All these layers are alike in that their
forward pass can be written as
$\mathbf{X}_{\texttt{out}}= \mathbf{W}\mathbf{X}_{\texttt{in}}+ \mathbf{b}$
for some matrix $\mathbf{W}$ and some vector $\mathbf{b}$. In `conv` and
`attn` layers, $\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are determined as some
function of the input $\mathbf{X}_{\texttt{in}}$. In `conv` layers this
function is very simple: just make a Toeplitz matrix that repeats the
convolutional kernel(s) to match the dimensionality of
$\mathbf{X}_{\texttt{in}}$. In `attn` layers the function that
determines $\mathbf{W}$ is a bit more involved, as we saw above, and
typically we don't use biases $\mathbf{b}$.

Each of these layers can be represented as a matrix, and examining the
structure in these matrices can be a useful way to understand their
similarities and differences. The matrix for an `fc` layer is full rank,
whereas the matrices for `conv` and `attn` layers have low-rank
structure, but different kinds of low-rank structure. In
@fig-transformers-affine_layer_comparison, we show what these matrices
look like, and also catalog some of the other important properties of
each of these layers.

## Concluding Remarks

As of this writing, transformers are the dominant architecture in
computer vision and in fact in most fields of artificial intelligence.
They combine many of the best ideas from earlier
architectures---convolutional patchwise processing, residual
connections, relu nonlinearities, and normalization layers---with
several newer innovations, in particular, vector-valued tokens,
attention layers, and positional codes. Transformers can also be
considered as a special case of **graph neural networks** (**GNNs**). We
do not have a separate chapter on GNNs in this book since GNNs, other
than transformers, are not yet popular in computer vision. GNNs are a
very general class of architecture for processing *sets* by forming a
graph of operations over the set. A transformer is doing exactly that:
it takes an input set of tokens and, layer by layer, applies a network
of transformations over that set until after enough layers a final
representation or prediction is read out.
