# Blur Filters {#chap-blur_filters}

## Introduction

Blur filters are low-pass filters. They remove the high
spatial-frequency content from an image leaving only the low-frequency
spatial components. The result is an image that has lost details and
that looks **blurry**. Image blur has many applications in computer
graphics and computer vision. It can be used to reduce noise (as shown
in @fig-stop_256_noise_3), to reveal image structures at different
scales, or for upsampling and downsampling images.

Blurring is implemented by computing local averages over small
neighborhoods of input pixel values. This can be done by a convolution.
However, there are nonlinear approaches for removing image details such
as anisotropic diffusion @Perona1990 and bilateral filtering @Paris2009.
These nonlinear blurring techniques can be useful when we want to remove
noise while preserving some image details such as contours.

In this chapter we will focus on linear filters for image blurring. We
will describe three popular families of blurring filters, discussing
properties and limitations.

## Box Filter

Let's start with a very simple low-pass filter, the box filter. In
section [\[sec-box_function\]](#sec:box_function){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-box_function"} we presented the box function. The box
filter uses a box function as the convolution kernel. The box
convolution kernel can be written as:

$$\text{box}_{N,M} \left[n,m \right] =\begin{cases}
    1       & \quad \text{if } -N \leq n \leq N  \text{~and~}  -M \leq m \leq M\\
    0       & \quad \text{otherwise.} 
  \end{cases}$$

Filtering an input image, $\ell_{\texttt{in}}$, with a box filter
results in the following: $$\begin{aligned}
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m\right] &=& \text{box}_{N,M} \left[n,m\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n,m\right] \nonumber \\
&=&  \sum_{k,l} \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n-k,m-l \right] \text{box}_{N,M} \left[k,l \right] \nonumber \\
&=&  \sum_{k=-N}^N \sum_{l=-M}^M \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n-k,m-l \right]
\end{aligned}$$ That is, the output value on each location $(n,m)$ is
the sum of the input pixels within the rectangle around that location.

Visually, filtering an image with the box filter results in blurring the
picture. @fig-convExamps2 shows some box filters and the corresponding
output images (after normalizing the box filter coefficients so that
they sum to 1). @fig-convExamps2a shows an image convolved with a
squared box kernel (i.e., $N=M$).

Figures [\[fig:convExamps2\]](#fig-convExamps2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:convExamps2"}(b) and
[\[fig:convExamps2\]](#fig-convExamps2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:convExamps2"}(c) show the results of blurring in just one
direction. Blur happens very often in real life. It happens when we look
at something very far away, or at some detail inside a picture, or when
we remove our eyeglasses (or wear some that are not ours).

### Properties

The box filter is a low-pass filter. That is, it attenuates the high
spatial-frequency content of the input image.

As we already mentioned in section
[\[sec-box_function\]](#sec:box_function){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-box_function"}, the two-dimensional (2D) box filter is
separable as it can be written as the convolution of two 1D kernels:
$\text{box}_{N,M} \left[n,m \right]  = \text{box}_{N,0} \circ \text{box}_{0,M}$.
When the box is large, it can be implemented efficiently using the
integral image @Viola01.

One important property of a low-pass filter is the **DC gain**[^1], that
is, the gain it has for a constant value input (i.e., the lowest
possible input frequency). If the input signal is a constant, i.e.,
$\ell[n,m] = a$, where $a$ is a real number, the result of convolving
the image with the box filter $h_{N,M}$ is also a constant:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m\right] = \sum_{k,l} a \text{box}_{N,M} \left[k,l \right] = a \sum_{k,l} \text{box}_{N,M} \left[k,l \right]  = a (2N+1)(2M+1)$$

In general, The DC gain of an arbitrary filter $h [n,m]$ is the sum of
its kernel values, $$\text{DC~gain} = \sum_{n,m} h [n,m]$$ In the
example of the box filter with $N=1$, the DC gain is 3.

In the frequency domain, the DC gain of a filter refers to its gain at
frequency of 0. This gain is represented by the value $H[0,0]$, where
$H$ is the result of applying the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
the filter's kernel $h$. This can be easily proven by checking the
definition of the DFT and setting the spatial frequencies to zero. One
can verify in @fig-boxfilter that the value of
$\left| \text{Box}_1[0] \right|$ is $3$. The DC gain of a filter will
change the mean value of the input signal.

   \(a\)
  -------

  -------
   \(b\)
  -------

When designing blur kernels (low-pass filters), we generally want to
have a DC gain of 1. The reason is that if we have an image with
grayscale levels in the range of 0 to 256 and with an average around
128, we will want to preserve the same mean value in the output. For
this reason, in most applications, we will normalize the kernel values
so that they sum 1. In the case of the box filter this means dividing
the kernel values by $(2N+1)(2M+1)$.

### Limitations

The box filter is simple to implement and to understand, but it has a
number of limitations:

-   The box filter is not a perfect blurring filter. A blur filter
    should attenuate high spatial frequencies with stronger attenuation
    for higher spatial frequencies. However, if you consider the highest
    spatial frequency, which will be an oscillating signal that takes
    successively on the values 1 and $-1$:
    $\left[..., 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ... \right]$ when filtered with the
    box filter $\text{box}_{1}$ the result is the same oscillating
    signal! However, if you filter a wave with lower frequency such as
    $\left[..., 0.5, 0.5, -1, 0.5, 0.5, -1, ... \right]$ then the result
    is $\left[..., 0,0,0,0, ...\right]$. Therefore, the attenuation is
    not monotonic with spatial frequency as it is shown in
    @fig-boxfilter. This is not a desirable behavior for a blurring
    filter and it can cause artifacts to appear. This could be addressed
    using an even size box filter $\left[1,1 \right]$. However, an even
    box filter is not centered around the origin and the output image
    will have a half-pixel translation. Therefore, odd filter sizes are
    preferred.

    

-   If you convolve two boxes you do not get another box. Instead you
    get a triangle. You can easily check this by convolving two box
    filters. For instance, in the simple case where $N=1, M=0$:
    $$\text{box}_{1,0} \circ \text{box}_{1,0} = \left[1, 1, 1\right] \circ \left[1, 1, 1\right] = \left[1,2,3,2,1\right]$$
    the output is a **triangular filter** with length $2\times L-1$,
    with $L=3$ the length of the box filter. When convolving two box
    filters of different length the result will be a truncated triangle.
    Although that is not a problem at first sight, it means that if you
    blur an image twice with box filters, what you get is not the
    equivalent to blurring only once with a larger box filter.

The next low-pass filter addresses both of these issues.

## Gaussian Filter {#sec-spt_gaussian}

One of the important blurring (low-pass) filters in computer vision is
the Gaussian filter. The Gaussian filter is important because it is a
good model for many naturally occurring filters. It also has a number of
properties, as we will discuss here, that make it unique.

The Gaussian distribution is defined in continuous variables. In one
dimension:
$$g(x; \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp{ \left( -\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) }
$${#eq-gauss1dcont} and in two dimensions:
$$g(x,y; \sigma) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} \exp{ \left(-\frac{x^2 +   y^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) }
$${#eq-gauss2dcont} The parameter $\sigma$ adjusts the spatial extend of
the Gaussian. The normalization constant is set so that the function
integrates to 1. The Gaussian kernel is positive and symmetric (a
zero-phase filter).

### Discretization

In order to use this filter in practice we need to consider discrete
locations and also approximate the function by a finite support
function. In practice, we only need to consider samples within three
standard deviations $x \in (-3\sigma, 3\sigma)$. At $3\sigma$ the
amplitude of the Gaussian filter is around 1 percent of its central
value. Unfortunately, many of the properties of the Gaussian filter that
we will discuss later are only true in the continuous domain and are
only approximated when using its discrete form.

For a given standard deviation parameter, $\sigma$, the discretized
Gaussian kernel is $g \left[n, m; \sigma \right]$:
$$g \left[ n,m; \sigma \right] = \exp{ \left( -\frac{n^2 + m^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) }$${#eq-gauss2d} We have removed the normalization constant as the sum of
the discrete Gaussian will be different from the integral of the
continuous function. So here we prefer to define the form in which the
value at the origin is 1. In practice, we should normalize the discrete
Gaussian by the sum of its values to make sure that the DC gain is 1.



By adjusting the standard deviation, $\sigma$, of the Gaussian, it is
possible to adjust the level of image detail that appears in the blurred
image. @fig-zebragaussian shows the result of narrow and wider
Gaussians applied to an image.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The $n$-dimensional Gaussian filter has the additional computational
advantage that it can be applied as a concatenation of $n$ 1D Gaussian
filters. This can be seen by writing the 2D Gaussian, equation
(@eq-gauss2d), in the convolution equation, equation (@eq-2dconv).
Letting $g^x$ and $g^y$ be the 1D Gaussian convolution kernels in the
horizontal and vertical directions (i.e., $g^x [n]=g[n,0]$, and
$g^y[m]=g[0,m]$), we have $$\begin{aligned}g \left[n,m \right] \circ \ell\left[n,m\right] 
& = & \sum_{k,l}
g \left[n-k,m-l \right] \ell\left[k,l \right] \\
& = & \sum_{k,l}
\exp{ \left( -\frac{(n-k)^2 + (m-l)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) }
\circ \ell\left[n,m \right] \\
& = & 
\sum_{k}
\exp{ \left( -\frac{(n-k)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) }
\left(
\sum_{l}
 \exp{ \left( -\frac{(m-l)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) } \ell\left[k,l \right] 
 \right)
 \\
& = &
g^x \circ (g^y \circ \ell\left[n,m \right])

\end{aligned}$${#eq-2dgauss} This can save quite a bit in computation time when
applying the convolution of equation (@eq-2dgauss). If the 2D
convolution kernel is $N \times N$ samples, then a direct convolution of
that 2D kernel scales in proportion to $N^2$, since equation
(@eq-2dgauss) requires one multiplication per image position per kernel
sample. Using the cascade of two 1D kernels, resulting in an equivalent
2D filter of the same size, scales in proportion to $2N$.

Another application of blurring is to remove distracting high-resolution
image details. @fig-lincoln shows a Gaussian low-pass filter applied to
remove unwanted image details (the blocky artifacts) from an image
@Harmon_1973.

### Properties of the Continuous Gaussian

-   The $n$-dimensional Gaussian is the only completely circularly
    symmetric operator that is separable.

-   The continuous Fourier transform (FT) of a Gaussian is also a
    Gaussian. For a 1D Gaussian, its Fourier transform is:
    $$G (w; \sigma) = \exp{ \left( -\frac{w^2 \sigma^2} {2} \right) }$$    and in 2D the Fourier transform is:
    $$G (w_x, w_y; \sigma) = \exp{ \left(- \frac{(w_x^2+w_y^2) \sigma^2} {2} \right) }
    $${#eq-FTgauss2d} Note that this function is monotonically decreasing
    in magnitude for increasing frequencies, and it is also radially
    symmetric.

-   The width of the Gaussian Fourier transform decreases with $\sigma$
    (this is the opposite behavior to the Gaussian in the spatial
    domain).

-   The convolution of two $n$-dimensional Gaussians is an
    $n$-dimensional Gaussian.
    $$g (x,y; \sigma_1 ) \circ g (x,y; \sigma_2)  = g (x,y; \sigma_3)$$
    where the variance of the result is the sum
    $\sigma_3^2 = \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2$. This is a remarkable
    property of Gaussian filters and is the basis of the Gaussian
    pyramid that we will see later in chapter
    [\[chapter-image_pyramids\]](#sec-image_pyramids){reference-type="ref"
    reference="chapter-image_pyramids"}. To prove this property, one can
    use the Fourier transform of the Gaussian and the fact that the
    convolution is the product of Fourier transforms.

-   The Gaussian is the solution to the heat equation.

-   Repeated convolutions of any function concentrated in the origin
    result in a Gaussian (central limit theorem).

-   In the limit $\sigma \rightarrow 0$ the Gaussian becomes an impulse.
    This property is shared by many other functions, but it is a useful
    thing to know.

### Limitations

However, many of these properties are only true for the continuous
version of the Gaussian and do not work for its discrete approximation
$g\left[n,m;\sigma \right]$ obtained by directly sampling the values of
the Gaussian at discrete locations. To see this, let's look at one
example in 1D. Let's consider a Gaussian with variance $\sigma^2=1/2$.
It can be approximated by five samples. We will call this approximation
$g_5$ and it takes the values:
$$g_5\left[ n \right] = \left[0.0183, \,    0.3679, \,    1.0000, \,    0.3679, \,    0.0183 \right]$$

You can check that if you compute the approximation for $\sigma^2=1$ by
discretizing the Gaussian, the result obtained is not equal to doing
$g_5 \circ g_5$. Therefore, as you apply successive convolutions of
discretized Gaussians the errors will accumulate. That is, the
convolution of discretized Gaussians is not a Gaussian anymore.

Note that the convolution of $g_5\left[ n \right]$ with the wave
$\left[1,-1,1,-1,...\right]$ is not zero. This is to be expected from
the form of the FT of the Gaussian. This is not a strong limitation and
in many applications it does not matter. However, in some cases is
important to completely cancel the highest frequencies (like when
applying antialiasing filters as we will see later).

The next low-pass filter addresses the limitations of the box and
Gaussian filters.

## Binomial Filters

In practice, there are very efficient discrete approximations to the
Gaussian filter that, for certain $\sigma$ values, have nicer properties
than when working with discretized Gaussians. One common approximation
of the Gaussian filter is to use **binomial coefficients** @Chehikian91.
Binomial filters are obtained by successive convolutions of the box
filter $\left[1,1\right]$.

The binomial coefficients use the central limit theorem to approximate a
Gaussian as successive convolutions of a very simple function. The
binomial coefficients form the **Pascal's triangle** as shown in
@fig-pascaltriangle.

:::

Each row of @fig-pascaltriangle shows one 1D-binomial kernel. The first
binomial kernel, $b_0$, is the impulse.

### Properties

-   Binomial coefficients provide a compact approximation of the
    Gaussian coefficients using only integers. Note that the values of
    $b_2$ are different from $g_5$ despite that both will be used as
    approximations to the a Gaussian with the same variance
    $\sigma^2 = 1/2$. The thing to note is that the variance of $g_5$ is
    not really $\sigma^2 = 1/2$ despite of being obtained by
    discretizing a Gaussian with that variance.

-   The sum of all the coefficients (DC gain) for each binomial filter
    $b_n$ is $2^n$, and their spatial variance is $\sigma^2 = n/4$.

-   One remarkable property of the binomial filters is that
    $b_n \circ b_m = b_{n+m}$, and, therefore,
    $\sigma_n^2 + \sigma_m^2  = \sigma_{n+m}^2$, which is the analogous
    to the Gaussian property in the continuous domain. That is, the
    convolution of two binomial filters is another binomial filter.

-   The simplest approximation to the Gaussian filter is the 3-tap
    binomial kernel: $$b_2 = \left[1, 2, 1\right]$$ This filter is
    interesting because it is even (so it can be applied to an image
    without producing any translation) and its discrete Fourier
    transform (DFT) is: $$B_2 \left[u\right] = 2+2 \cos (2 \pi u/N)$$
    The frequency gain is shown in @fig-gauss3filterb. The gain
    decreases monotonically (there are no ripples) with spatial
    frequency, $u$, and it becomes zero at the highest frequency,
    $G_3 \left[ 10 \right]=0$.

      -------
       \(a\)
      -------

      -------
       \(b\)
      -------

-   All the even binomial filters can be written as successive
    convolutions with the kernel $\left[1,2,1\right]$. Therefore, their
    Fourier transform is a power of the Fourier transform of the filter
    $\left[1,2,1\right]$ and therefore they are also monotonic:
    $$B_{2n} \left[u\right] = (2+2 \cos (2 \pi u/N))^n$$ The filter
    transfer function, $B_{2n}$, is real and positive. It is a
    **zero-phase filter**.

-   For all the binomial filters $b_n$, when they are convolved with the
    wave $\left[1,-1,1,-1,...\right]$, the result is the zero signal
    $\left[0,0,0,0,...\right]$. This is a very nice property of binomial
    filters and will become very useful later when talking about
    downsampling an image (see chapter
    [\[chap-downsampling_and_upsampling\]](#chap:downsampling_and_upsampling){reference-type="ref"
    reference="chap-downsampling_and_upsampling"}).

### 2D Binomial Filters

The Gaussian in 2D can be approximated, using separability, as the
convolution of two binomial filters one vertical and another horizontal.
For instance: $$b_{2,2} = b_{2,0} \circ b_{0,2} =  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 ~& 2 ~& 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}\circ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  2 \\
  1
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 ~& 2 ~& 1 \\
  2 ~& 4 ~& 2\\
  1~& 2 ~& 1
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

The filter $b_{2,2}$ has a DC gain of 16, so we will divide the
convolution output by 16 so that the output image has a similar contrast
to the input image.

@fig-boat_b_noise shows an image corrupted by high-frequency
checkerboard-pattern noise. The next two images are the result of
filtering the noisy image with a $3\times3$ box filter (middle) and with
the $b_{2,2}$ binomial filter. The $3\times3$ box filter cannot
completely eliminate the noise, while the binomial filter can perfectly
cancel this checkerboard noise. Both the box and the binomial filter
reduce the resolution of the input image.

## Concluding Remarks

The Gaussian and the binomial filters are widely used in computer
vision. In particular, the binomial filter $[1,2,1]/4$ (here normalized
so that its DC gain is 1), and its 2D extension, are very useful kernels
that you can use in many situations like, when you need to remove
high-frequency noise, or downsample an image by a factor of 2. Blur
kernels are useful when building image pyramids, or in neural networks
when performing different pooling operations or when resizing feature
maps.

[^1]: Remember that the DC value of a signal is its mean value. DC is an
    old name derived from Direct Current.
