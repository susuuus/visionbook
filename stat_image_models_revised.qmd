# Statistical Image Models {#sec-stat_image_models}

## Introduction

Building statistical models for images is an active area of research in
which there has been remarkable progress. Understanding the world of
images and finding rules that describe the pixel arrangements that are
likely to be present in an image and which arrangements are not seems
like a very challenging task. What we will see in this chapter is that
some of the linear filters that we have seen in the previous chapters
have remarkable properties when applied to images that allow us to put
constraints on a model that aims to capture what real images look like.

First, we need to understand what we mean by a **natural image**. An
image is a very high dimensional array of pixels $\ell\left[n,m\right]$
and therefore, the space of all possible images is very large. Even if
you consider very small thumbnails of just $32\times32$ pixels and three
color channels, with 8 bits per channel, there are more than
$10^{7,398}$ possible images. Of course, most of them will just be
random noise. @fig-spaces_real_images shows one image, with size
$32\times32$ color pixels, sampled from the set of natural images, and
on typical example from the set of all images. A typical sample from the
set of all images is $32\times32$ pixels independently sampled from a
uniform distribution.

As natural images are quite complex, researchers have used simple visual
worlds that retain some of the important properties of natural images
while allowing the development of analytic tools to characterize them.
In the last decade, researchers have developed large neural networks
that learned generative models of images and we discuss these models
more in depth in chapter
[\[chapter-generative_models\]](#sec-generative_models){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-generative_models"}. In this chapter we will focus on
simpler image models as they will serve as motivation for some of the
concepts that will be used later when describing generative models.

@fig-worlds shows images that belong to different visual worlds. Each
world has different visual characteristics. We can clearly differentiate
images as belonging to any of these eight worlds, even if those visual
worlds look like nothing we normally see when walking around. Explaining
what makes images in the set of real images (@fig-worlds\[h\]) different
to images in the other sets is not a simple task.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/worlds.png){width="100%"}

In this chapter we will talk, in some way or another, about all these
visual worlds. The goal is to present a set of models that can be used
to describe images with different properties. We will describe models
that can be used to capture what makes each visual world unique. These
models can be used to separate images into different causes, to remove
noise from images, to predict the missing high-frequencies in blurry
images, to fill in regions of missing image information due to
occlusions, etc.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/noiseInTheWorld.png){width="100%"}

## How Do We Tell Noise from Texture?

How do we tell noise from texture? @fig-noiseInTheWorld shows two
scenes: one image is corrupted with additive stationary noise added on
top of the image, the other image contains one object textured with a
pattern that looks like noise. Can you tell which one is which? Where is
the noise? Is it in the image or in the world?

Stationary image noise[^1] is independent of the content of the scene,
it is not affected by the object boundaries, it does not deform
following the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of the surfaces, and it
does not change frequency with distance between the camera and the
scene. If the noise was really in the world, stationary noise would
require a special noise distribution that conspires with the observer
viewpoint to appear stationary.

Noise is an independent process from the image content, and our visual
system does not perceive noise as a strange form of paint. One important
task is image processing it image denoising. Image denoising consists in
removing the noise from an image automatically. This is equivalent to
being able to separate the image into two components, one looking like a
clean uncorrupted picture and the second image containing only noise.
Statistical image models try to do this and more.



There is a significant interest in building image models that can
represent whatever makes real photographs unique relative to, say,
images that just contain noise. One way of building an image model is by
having some procedural description, for instance a list of objects with
locations, poses, and styles and a rendering engine, just as one would
do when writing a program to generate CGI. One issue with this way of
modeling images is that it will be hard to use it, and will require
having an exhaustive list of all the things that we can find in the
world. We will see later that the apparent explosion in complexity
should not stop us. However, there is another way of building image
models. In the rest of this chapter we will study a very different
approach that consists of building statistical models of images that try
to capture the properties of small image neighborhoods. Statistical
models are also foundational in other disciplines such as natural
language modeling. Here we will review models of images of increasing
complexity, starting with the simplest possible neighborhood: *the
single pixel*.

## Independent Pixels {#sec-independent_pixels}

The simplest image model will consist in assuming that all pixels are
independent and their intensity value is drawn from some stationary
distribution (i.e., the distribution of pixel intensities is independent
of the location in the image). We can then write the probability,
$p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol\ell)$, of an image, $\ell[n,m]$ with size
$N \times M$, as follows:
$$p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol\ell) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} \prod_{m=1}^{M} p_{\theta}\left(\ell[n,m] \right)$${#eq-histmodel} We use $p_{\theta}$ to denote a parameterized
probability model. The vector $\theta$ contains the parameters and can
be fitted to data using maximum likelihood or other loss functions. We
will see many variants of this probability model here and in the
following chapters.

One way of assessing the accuracy a statistical image model is to sample
from the model and view the images it produces. This will require
knowing the distribution $p_{\theta}\left(\ell[n,m] \right)$.

What we can do is to take one image from one of the visual worlds that
we described in the introduction, and then estimate the model
$p_{\theta}\left(\ell[n,m] \right)$, as illustrated in
@fig-model_training_vs_sampling.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/model_training_vs_sampling.png){width=".75"}

In the case of discrete gray-scale images with 256 gray levels, we can
represent the distribution $p_{\theta}$ as vector of 256 values
indicating the probability of each intensity value. In the case of
considering color images with 256 levels on each channel (i.e., 8 bits
per channel) we will have $256^3$ bins in the color histogram.



The parameters, $\theta$, of the distribution are those 256 (or $256^3$
for color) values. If we are given a set of images, we can estimate the
vector $\theta$ as the average histogram of the images. We can also
estimate the model from a single image. We can then sample new images
based on equation (@eq-histmodel). In order to sample a new image, we
will sample each pixel independently using the intensity distribution
given by the training set.

The procedure for four training images is shown in
@fig-model_hist_example. As illustrated in @fig-model_hist_example,
the process starts by computing the average color histogram for the four
images. Then, we sample a new image by sampling every pixel from the
multinomial defined by the $p_{\theta}$. 

![](figures/statistical_image_models/model_hist_example2.png){width="100%"}

@fig-histMatch shows four pairs of images with matched color
histograms. We can see that this simplistic model is somewhat
appropriate for pictures of stars (although star images can have a lot
more structure), but it miserably fails in reproducing anything with any
similarity (besides the overall color) to any of the other images. The
failure of color histograms as a generative model of images should not
be surprising as treating pixels as independent observations is clearly
not how images work.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/4_examples_images.png){width="100%"}

As a generative model of images, this model is very poor. However, this
does not mean that image histograms are not important. Manipulating
image histograms is a very useful operation. Given two images
$\boldsymbol\ell_1$ and $\boldsymbol\ell_2$ with histograms
$\mathbf{h}_1$ and $\mathbf{h}_2$, we look for a pixelwise
transformation $f\left(\ell[n,m] \right)$ so that the histogram of the
transformed image, $f\left(\ell_1 [n,m] \right)$, matches the histogram
of $\boldsymbol\ell_2$. There are many ways in which histograms can be
transformed. One natural choice is a transformation that preserves the
ordering of pixels intensities.

@fig-illumination shows examples of spheres that are reflecting some
complex ambient illumination. This is an example that illustrates the
perceptual importance of simple histogram manipulations. The two spheres
on the left are the two original images. The ones on the left are
generated by modifying the image histograms to match the histogram of
the opposite image. The figure shows that by simply changing the image
histogram we can transform how we perceive the material of each sphere:
from shiny to matte @Fleming2001. The sphere was first rendered with two
illumination models: from a campus photograph (@fig-illumination\[a\]),
and from pink noise (@fig-illumination\[b\]). Pink noise is random noise
with a $\frac{1}{|w_x^2+w_y^2|}$ power spectrum, where $w_x$ and $w_y$
are the spatial frequencies. In @fig-illuminationc and
@fig-illuminationd the sphere histograms were swapped, creating a
different sense of gloss in the sphere images. Note how by simply
modifying the image histograms within the pixels of the sphere, the
sphere seems to be made by a different type of material.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/illuminationHistograms.png){width="100%"}

Image histograms carry useful information, but the histogram alone fails
in capturing what makes images unique. We will need to build a more
sophisticated image model.

## Dead Leaves Model {#sec-dead_leavel_model}

In the quest to find what makes photographs of everyday scenes special,
the next simplest image structure is a set of two pixels. Things get a
lot more interesting now. If one plots the value of the intensity of one
pixel as a function of the intensity value of the pixel nearby, the
scatterplot produced by many pixel pairs (@fig-correlation) is
concentrated on the identity line. As we look at the correlation between
pixels that are farther away, the correlation value slowly decays. The
correlation, $C$, between two pixels separated by offsets of $\Delta n$
and $\Delta m$, is:
$$C(\Delta n, \Delta m) = \rho \left( \ell[n+\Delta n,m+ \Delta m], \ell[n,m] \right)$${#eq-correlation_between_two_pixels} where
$$\rho \left( a, b \right) = \frac{E \left( a-\bar{a}, b- \bar{b} \right)}{\sigma_a \sigma_b},$$where $\sigma_a$ is the standard deviation of the variable $a$, and
$\bar{a}$ is the mean of $a$.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/correlation.png){width="100%"}

The behavior of this correlation function when computed on natural
images is very different from the one we would observe if the
correlation was computed over white noise images.

There have been many efforts to model the minimal set of assumptions
needed in order to produce image-like random processes. The **dead
leaves model** is a simplified image formation model that tries to
approximate some of the properties observed for natural images. This
model was introduced in the 1960s by Matheron @Matheron1975 and
popularized by Ruderman in the 90's @Ruderman1997. The model is better
described by a procedure. An image is modeled as a set of shapes (dead
leaves) that fall on a flat surface generating a random superposition
(e.g., @fig-deadleaves).

![](figures/statistical_image_models/dead_leaves_squares_and_circles.png){width="100%"}

The dead leaves model produces very simple images that do not look
realistic, but it is useful in explaining the distribution of albedos in
natural images. This model is used by the Retinex algorithm @Land83 to
separate an image into illumination and albedo variations, as we saw in
chapter
[\[chapter-image_derivatives\]](#sec-image_derivatives){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-image_derivatives"}.

### The Power Spectrum of Natural Images

The correlation function from equation
(@eq-correlation_between_two_pixels) is related to the magnitude of the
Fourier transform of an image. 

:::{.column-margin}
The Fourier transform
of the autocorrelation of a signal is the square of magnitude of its
Fourier Transform. The square of the magnitude of the FT,
$\lVert \mathscr{L}(u,v) \rVert ^2$, is the power spectrum of a
signal.
:::



Interestingly, the one remarkable property of most natural images is
that if you take the 2D Fourier transform of an image, its magnitude
falls off as a power law in frequency:
$$\lVert \mathscr{L}(u,v) \rVert \simeq \frac{1}{  w  ^ \alpha}
$${#eq-power_law_natural_images} where $w$ denotes the radial spatial
frequency ($w = \sqrt{u + v}$), $\mathscr{L}(u,v)$ is the Fourier
transform of the image $\ell[n,m]$, and $\alpha \simeq 1$. And this is
true for all orientations (you can think of this as taking the Fourier
transform and looking at the profile of a slice that passes by the
origin).

The fact that most natural images follow equation
(@eq-power_law_natural_images) has been the focus of an extensive
literature @Field1987, @VANDERSCHAAF1996, and it has been shown to be
related to several properties of the early visual system
@Atick1990, @Atick1992 which is adapted to process natural images. We
will see in the next section how this model can be used to solve a
number of image processing tasks.

@fig-FT_angular_averages shows three natural images and the magnitude
of their FT (middle row), and compares them to a random image where each
pixel is independently sampled from a uniform distribution. The
frequency $(0,0)$ lies in the middle of each FT. From the images in the
middle row, we can see that the largest amplitudes concentrate in the
low spatial frequencies for the natural images (we already discussed
this in chapter
[\[chapter-fourier_analysis\]](#sec-fourier_analysis){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-fourier_analysis"}). However, the random image has
similar spectral content at all frequencies. In order to better
appreciate the particular decay in the spectral amplitude with
frequency, we can express the FT using polar coordinates, then calculate
the average magnitude of the FT by aggregating the values over all
angular directions. The result is shown in the bottom row of
@fig-FT_angular_averages. The plot also shows three additional curves
corresponding to $1/w$, $1/w^{1.5}$, and $1/w^2$. The plots are
normalized to start at 1. These images have size
512$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}512. The frequency ranges used for the plot
are $w \in [20,256]$. As we can see from the middle row, there are
differences on how spectral content is organized across orientations,
but the decay along the radial frequency roughly follows a $1/w^{1.5}$
decay in these examples. And these property is shared across the four
images despite their very distinct appearance.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/FT_power_law_angular2.png){width="100%"}

We will now use this observation to build a better statistical model of
images than using pixel histograms as we described in @sec-independent_pixels.

## The Gaussian Model

We want to write a statistical image model that takes into account the
correlation statistics and the power spectrum of natural images (see
@Simoncelli2005 for a review). If the only constraint we have is the
correlation function among image pixels, which mean that among all the
possible distributions, the one that has the maximum entropy (thus,
imposing the fewest other constraints) is the Gaussian distribution:
$$p(\boldsymbol\ell) \propto \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol\ell^\mathsf{T}{\bf C}^{-1} \boldsymbol\ell\right)$${#eq-gaussianmodel} where ${\bf C}$ is the covariance matrix of all the
image pixels. Note that this model no longer assumes independence across
pixels. It accounts for the correlation of intensity values between
different pixels, as discussed in previous sections. This model is also
related to studies that use principal component analysis to study the
typical components of natural images @Hancock1970.

For stationary signals, the covariance matrix ${\bf C}$ has a circulant
structure (assuming a tiling of the image) and can be diagonalized using
the Fourier transform. The eigenvalues of the diagonal matrix correspond
to the power (squared magnitude) of the frequency components of the
Fourier transform. This is, the matrix ${\bf C}$ can be written as
${\bf C} = {\bf F}{\bf D}{\bf F}^\mathsf{T}$. Where ${\bf F}$ is the
matrix that contains the Fourier basis, as seen in chapter
[\[chapter-fourier_analysis\]](#sec-fourier_analysis){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-fourier_analysis"}, and the diagonal matrix ${\bf D}$
has, along the diagonal, the values $1/ w  ^\alpha$ for all radial
frequencies $w$. The value of $\alpha$ can be set to a fix value of 1.5.

### Sampling Images

Once a distribution is defined, we can use it to sample new images.
First we need to specify the parameters of the distribution. In this
case, we need to specify the covariance matrix ${\bf C}$.
@fig-figure_samples_1_over_f shows the results of sampling images using
the $1/ w^\alpha$ model to fill the diagonal values of the matrix
${\bf D}$. These images are generated by making an image with a random
phase and with a magnitude of the power spectrum following
$1/(1+w ^\alpha)$ with $\alpha=1.5$. We add 1 to the denominator term to
avoid division by zero. The bottom row of @fig-figure_samples_1_over_f
generates color images by sampling each color channel independently.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/figure_samples_1_over_f.png){width="100%"}

We can also sample new images by matching the parameter of individual
natural images. @fig-magFTMatch shows four examples. To process color
images, we first look for a color space that decorrelates color
information for each image. This can be done by applying principal
component analysis (PCA) to the three color channels. This results in a
3$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}3 matrix that will produce three new channels
that are decorrelated. Then, for each channel, we compute the FT and
keep the magnitude and replace the phase with random noise. We finally
compute the new generated imaged by doing the inverse FT and applying
the inverse of the PCA matrix in order to return to the original color
space. This results in images that keep a similar color distribution
than the inputs.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/4_examples_images_color_FT.png){width="100%"}

As shown in @fig-magFTMatch, when fitting the Gaussian model to
different real images, and then sampling from it, the result is always
an image that looks like cloudy noise regardless of the image content.
However, a few attributes of the original image are preserved including
the size of the details present in the image and the dominant
orientations.

@fig-hair shows an example image where the sample from its Gaussian
model produces a similar image, due to the strong oriented pattern
present in the image. In this example, the input image is mostly
one-dimensional (1D) as most of the variations occur across one
orientation being constant along the perpendicular direction. This
structure can be captured by the magnitude of the Fourier transform of
the image.

The Gaussian image model, despite being very simple, can be used to
study some image processing tasks, including image denoising, which we
will discuss next.



:::{.column-margin}
Devising processes that generate realistic textures
has a long history and many applications in the movie industry. One
example is Perlin noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1985. In the rest of
this book, we will study in depth the image generation problem when
talking about generative models.
:::



### Image Denoising under the Gaussian Model: Wiener Filter {#sec-image_denoising_gaussian_model}

As an example of how to use image priors for vision tasks, we will study
how to do image denoising using the prior on the structure of the
correlation of natural images. In this problem, we observe a noisy image
$\boldsymbol\ell_g$ corrupted with white Gaussian noise:
$$\ell_g[n, m] = \ell[n, m] + g[n, m]$$ The goal is to recover theuncorrupted image $\ell[n,m]$. The noise $g[m, n]$ is white Gaussian
noise with variance $\sigma_g^2$. The denoising problem can be
formulated as finding the $\ell[n,m]$ that maximizes the probability of
the uncorrupted image, $\boldsymbol\ell_g$, called the maximum a
posteriori, or MAP, estimate:
$$\max_{\boldsymbol\ell} p(\boldsymbol\ell\bigm | \boldsymbol\ell_g)$$

In these equations we write the image as a column vector
$\boldsymbol\ell$. This posterior density can be written as:
$$\max_{\boldsymbol\ell} p({\boldsymbol\ell} \bigm | {\boldsymbol\ell}_g) = \max_{\boldsymbol\ell} p({\boldsymbol\ell}_g \bigm | {\boldsymbol\ell}) p({\boldsymbol\ell})$$
where the likelihood and prior functions are: $$\begin{aligned}
p({\boldsymbol\ell}_g \bigm | {\boldsymbol\ell}) & \propto & \exp( - \left| {\boldsymbol\ell}_g - {\boldsymbol\ell} \right| ^2 / \sigma_g^2) \\ 
p({\boldsymbol\ell}) & \propto & \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} {\boldsymbol\ell}^T {\bf C}^{-1} {\boldsymbol\ell} \right)
\end{aligned}$$

The solution to this problem can be obtained in closed form:
$${\boldsymbol\ell} = {\bf C} \left( {\bf C} + \sigma_g^2   \mathbf{I} \right)^{-1} {\boldsymbol\ell}_g$$
This is just a linear operation. It can also be written in the Fourier
domain as:
$$\mathscr{L}(v) = \frac{A/|v|^{2\alpha}}{A/|v|^{2\alpha} + \sigma_g^2} \mathscr{L}_g(v)$$

@fig-denoisingGaussianModel shows the result of using the Gaussian
image model for image denoising. Although there is a certain amount of
noise reduction, the result is far from satisfactory. The Gaussian image
model fails to capture the properties that make a natural image look
real.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/denoisingGaussianModel.png){width="100%"}

## The Wavelet Marginal Model

As we showed previously, sampling from a Gaussian prior model generates
images of clouds. Although the Gaussian prior does not give any image
zero probability (i.e., by sampling for a very long time it is not
impossible to sample the Mona Lisa), the most typical images under this
prior look like clouds.

The Gaussian model captures the fact that pixel values are correlated
and that such correlation decreases with distance. However, it fails to
capture other very important properties of images, such as flat regions,
edges, and lines. Here, we extend the Gaussian model in two ways. (1) We
will use localized filters instead of sinusoids (i.e., Fourier basis)
that span the entire image, as in the power spectrum model used in the
previous section. This helps to capture local structure such as lines
and edges. (2) Instead of characterizing the outputs of those filters by
a single number (e.g., the mean power), we measure the histogram shape
of all the filter responses.

In the 1980s, a number of papers noticed a remarkable property of
images: when filtering images with band-pass filters (i.e, image
derivatives, Gabor filters, etc.) the output had a non-Gaussian
distribution @Daugman1989, @Field1987. @fig-derivativeshist shows the
histogram of the input image and the histogram of the output of applying
the filters $\left[-1,1\right]$ and $\left[-1,1\right]^\mathsf{T}$.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/figure_histograms_derivatives_street.png){width="100%"}

First, the histogram of an unfiltered image is already non-Gaussian.
However, the image histogram does not have any interesting structure and
different images have different histograms. Something very different
happens to the outputs of the filters $\left[-1,1\right]$ and
$\left[-1,1\right]^\mathsf{T}$. The histograms of the filter outputs are
very clean (note that they are computed over the same number of pixels),
have a unique maximum around zero, and seem to be symmetric.

Note that this distribution of the filter outputs goes against the
hypothesis of the Gaussian model. If the Gaussian image model were
correct, then any filtered image would also be Gaussian, as a filtering
is just a linear operation over the image.
@fig-derivativesdistributions makes this point, showing histograms of
band-pass filtered images (an image containing Gaussian noise, and two
natural images). Note that the image subband histograms are
significantly different than Gaussian.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/examplesderivativedistributions.png){width="100%"}

The distribution of intensity values in the image filtered by a
band-pass filter $h$,
$\boldsymbol\ell_h = \boldsymbol\ell\circ \mathbf{h}$, can be
parameterized by a simple function:
$$p(\ell_h[n,m] = x) = \frac{\exp \left(- \left| x/s  \right|^r \right)}{2 (s/r) \Gamma(1/r)}
$${#eq-derdist}

Where $\Gamma$ is the Gamma distribution. This function, equation
(@eq-derdist), known as the generalized Laplacian distribution, has two
parameters: the exponent $r$, which alters the distribution's shape; and
the scale parameter $s$, which influences its variance. This
distribution fits the outputs of band-pass filters of natural images
remarkably well. In natural images, typical values of $r$ lie within the
range $\left[0.4, 0.8\right]$.

 @fig-generalizedgaussian shows the shape of the distribution
when changing the parameter $r$. Setting $r=2$ gives the Gaussian
distribution. With $r=1$ we obtain the standard Laplacian distribution.
When $r \to \infty$ the distribution converges to a uniform distribution
in the range $\left[-s, s\right]$. And when $r \to 0$, the distribution
converges to a delta function.

![](figures/statistical_image_models/shapes_generalized_laplacian.png){width="100%"}

Now that we have seen that image derivatives follow a special
distribution for natural images, let's define a statistical image model
that captures the distribution of image derivatives. We can use this
prior model in synthesis and noise cleaning applications.

Let's consider a filter bank of $K$ filters with the convolution
kernels: $h_k [n,m]$ with $k=0, ..., K-1$. The filter bank could be
composed of several Gaussian derivatives with different orientations and
orders, or Gabor filters, or steerable filters from the steerable
pyramid, or any other collection of band-pass filters. If we assume that
the output of each filter is independent from each other (clearly, this
assumption is only an approximation) we can write the following prior
model for natural images:
$$p(\boldsymbol\ell) = \prod_{k=0}^{K-1} \prod_{n,m} p_k(\ell_k [n,m])$${#eq-waveletmodel} This distribution is the product over all filters and
all locations, of how likely is each filtered value according to the
distribution of natural images as modeled by the distributions $p_k$,
where $p_k$ is a distribution with the form from equation (@eq-derdist).

To see how this model works, let's look at a toy problem.

### Toy Model of Image Inpainting

To build intuition about image structures that are likely under the
wavelet marginal model, let's consider a simple 1D image of length
$N=11$ that has a missing value in the middle:
$$\boldsymbol\ell= \left[1,~ 1,~ 1,~ 1,~ 1,~ ?,~ 0,~ 0,~ 0,~ 0,~ 0\right]$$The middle value is missing because of image corruption or occlusion and
we want to guess the most likely pixel intensity at that location. This
task is called **image inpainting**. In order to guess the value of the
missing pixel we will use the image prior models we have presented in
this chapter.

We will denote the missing value with the variable $a$. Different values
of $a$ will produce different types of steps. For instance, setting
$a=1$ or $a=0$ will produce a sharp step edge. Setting $a=0.5$ will
produce a smooth step signal. What is the value of $a$ that maximizes
the probability of this 1D image under the wavelet marginal model?

First, we need to specify the prior distribution. For this example we
will use a model specified by a single filter ($K=1$) with the
convolution kernel $[-1, 1]$, and we will use the distribution given by
equations (@eq-derdist) and (@eq-waveletmodel). In this case, we can
write the wavelet marginal model from equation (@eq-waveletmodel) in
close form. Applying the filter $\left[-1, 1\right]$ to the 1D signal
and using mirror boundary conditions, results in:
$$\boldsymbol\ell_0 = \boldsymbol\ell\circ \left[-1, 1\right] = \left[0,~0,~ 0,~0,~ 0,~ 1-a,~ a,~ 0,~ 0,~ 0,~ 0\right]$$

Now, we can use equation (@eq-waveletmodel) to obtain the probability of
$\boldsymbol\ell$ as a function of $a$: $$\begin{aligned}
p(\boldsymbol\ell\bigm | a) &=& \prod_{n=0}^{N-1} p(\ell_0 [n]  \bigm | a) = \\ %= \prod_{n} p(y [n]) \\
&=&\frac {\exp \left(- \left| (1-a)/s  \right|^r \right) \exp \left(- \left| a/s  \right|^r \right)}{(2s/r \Gamma(1/r))^N} =\\
&=&\frac{1}{(2s/r \Gamma(1/r))^N} \exp - \frac{\left| 1-a \right|^r+\left| a \right|^r} {s^r}  

\end{aligned}$${#eq-best_a_eqn} Note that the first factor only depends on $r$ and on
the signal length $N$, and the second factor depends on $r$ and the
missing value $a$. We are interested in finding the values of $a$ that
maximize the $p(\boldsymbol\ell\bigm | a)$ for each value of $r$.
Therefore, only the second factor is important for this analysis.
@fig-surface_best_a plots the value of the second factor of equation
(@eq-best_a_eqn) as we vary $a$ and $r$. The red line represent the
places where the function reaches a local maximum as a function of $a$
for every value of $r$.

For $r=2$ the best value of $a$ is $a=0.5$, and this solution is the
best for any value of $r>1$. For $r=1$, any value
$a \in \left[0,1\right]$ is equally good, and $p(\boldsymbol\ell)$
decreases for values of $a$ outside that range. And for $r<1$, the best
solution is for $a=0$ or $a=1$. Therefore, values of $r<1$ prefer sharp
step edges. Note that $a=0$ and $a=1$ are both the same step edge
translated by one pixel.

@fig-best_a shows the final result using two different values of $r$.
When using $r=2$, the result is a smooth signal (which is the same
output we would had gotten if we had used the Gaussian image prior). The
estimated value for $a$ is the average of the nearby values. For
$r=0.5$, the result is a sharp step edge. The estimated value of $a$ can
be equal to any of the two nearby values. In the plot shown in
@fig-best_a(right) corresponds to taking the value $a=1$.

### Image Denoising (Bayesian Image Estimation)

The highly kurtotic distribution of band-pass filter responses in images
provides a regularity that is very useful for image denoising. If we
assume zero-mean additive Gaussian noise of variance $\sigma^2$, and the
observed subband coefficient value $\hat{x} = \hat\ell_0 [n,m]$, where
$\hat\ell_0 [n,m]$ is the subband of the observed noisy input image,
then the likelihood of any coefficient value, $x=\ell_0 [n,m]$, is
$$p(\hat{x} \bigm | x) \propto \exp{ \left( -\frac{(x - \hat{x})^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) },$$where we are suppressing the normalization constants of equation
(@eq-derdist) for simplicity. The prior probability of any coefficient
value is the Laplacian distribution (assuming $r=1$) of the subbands,
$$p(x) \propto \exp{ \left( -\frac{\left| x \right|}{s} \right) }.$$ By
Bayes rule, the posterior probability is the product of those two
functions,
$$P(x \bigm | \hat{x}) \propto \exp{ \left( -\frac{\left| x \right|}{s} \right)} \exp{ \left( -\frac{(x - \hat{x})^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) }
$${#eq-posterior_w_given_y}

The plots of @fig-waveletBayes show how this works. The horizontal axis
for each plot is the value at a pixel of an image subband coefficient.
The blue curve, showing the Laplacian prior probability for the subband
values, is the same for all rows. The red line is the Gaussian
likelihood and it is centered in the observed coefficient, and it is
proportional to the probability that the true value had any other
coefficient value. The green line shows the posterior, equation
(@eq-posterior_w_given_y), for several different coefficient observation
values. @fig-waveletBayesa shows the result when a zero subband
coefficient is observed, resulting in the zero-mean Gaussian likelihood
term (red), and the posterior (black) with a maximum at zero. In
@fig-waveletBayesb an observation of 0.26 shifts the likelihood term,
but the posterior still has a peak at zero. And in @fig-waveletBayesc
an observed coefficient value of 1.22 yields a maximum posterior
probability estimate of 0.9.

@fig-bayeslut shows the resulting look-up table to modify the noisy
observation to the MAP estimate for the denoised coefficient value. Note
that this implements a **coring function** @Simoncelli96: if a
coefficient value is observed near zero, it is set to zero, based on the
very high prior probability of zero coefficient values.

## Nonparametric Markov Random Field Image Models

The Gaussian and kurtotic wavelet image priors both involve modeling the
image as a sum of statistically independent basis functions, Fourier
basis functions, in the case of the Gaussian model, or wavelets, in the
case of the wavelet image prior.

A powerful class of image models is known as **Markov random field**
(MRF) models. They have a precise mathematical form, which we will
describe later, in chapter
[\[chapter-probabilistic_graphical_models\]](#sec-probabilistic_graphical_models){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-probabilistic_graphical_models"}. For now, we present
the intuition for these models: if the values of enough pixels
surrounding a given pixel are specified, then the probability
distribution of the given pixel is independent of the other pixels in
the image. To fit and sample from the MRF structure requires the
mathematical tools of graphical models, to be introduced in chapter
[\[chapter-probabilistic_graphical_models\]](#sec-probabilistic_graphical_models){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-probabilistic_graphical_models"}. As we will see in
the following chapter, Efros and Leung @Efros99 introduced an algorithm
for texture synthesis that exploits intuitions about the Markov
structure of images to synthesize textures that are visually compelling.
The intuition of the Efros and Leung texture generation model is that if
you condition on a large enough region of nearby pixels around a center
pixel, that effectively determines the value of the central pixel. We
will study this algorithm in more detail in the next chapter devoted to
texture analysis and synthesis (chapter
[\[sec-textures\]](#chap:textures){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-textures"}). We will focus here on a similar algorithm
for the problem of image denoising.

### Denoising Model (Nonlocal Means)

Baudes, Coll, and Morel made use of that intuition to define the
**nonlocal means** denoising algorithm @Baudes2005. The nonlocal means
denoised image is a weighted sum of all other pixels in the image,
weighted by the similarity of the local neighborhoods of each pair of
pixels. More formally,
$$\ell_{\mbox{NLM}}[n,m] = \sum_{k,l} w_{n,m}[k,l] \ell[k,l]$$ where
$$w_{n,m}[k,l] = \frac{1}{Z_{n,m}} \exp{\frac{- \left| \ell[N_{k,l}] - \ell[N_{n,m}] \right| ^2}{h^2}},
    \label{fig:mask}$$ where $N_{i, j}$ denotes an $h \times h$ region
of pixels centered at $i, j$, and $Z_{n,m}$ is set so that the weights
over the image sum to one, that is $\sum_{kl} w_{n,m}[k,l] = 1$.

@fig-nlm1 shows the weighting functions for two images. The parameter
$h$ is typically set to $10 \sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the estimated
image noise standard deviation. Within figures
[\[fig:nlm1\]](#fig-nlm1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:nlm1"}(a
and b) at left is a grayscale image where the center position of
interest to be denoised is marked with a white star. The right side of
the figures shows for some value of $h$ in equation
([\[fig:mask\]](#fig-mask){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:mask"})
the weighting function $w_{n,m}[k,l]$ indicating which pixels are
averaged together to yield the nonlocal mean value placed at the starred
location in the denoised image. Note, for both figures
[\[fig:nlm1\]](#fig-nlm1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:nlm1"}(a
and b) the sampling at image regions with similar local structure as the
image position to be denoised.

## Concluding Remarks

The models presented in this chapter do not try to understand the
content of the pictures, but utilize low-level regularities of images in
order to build a statistical model. Modeling these statistical
regularities enable many tasks, including both image synthesis and image
denoising.

We have see some simple models that try to constrain the space of
natural images. These models, despite their simplicity, are useful in
several applications. However, they fail in providing a strong image
model that can be used to sample new images. As illustrated in
@fig-spaces_real_images_final the sequence of models we have studied in
this chapter, only help in reducing a bit the space of possible images.

We will see stronger generative image models in chapter
[\[chapter-generative_models\]](#sec-generative_models){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-generative_models"}.
