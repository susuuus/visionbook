# Computer Vision and Society {#sec-computer_vision_and_society}

## Introduction

The success of computer vision has led to vision algorithms playing an
ever-larger role in society. Face recognition algorithms unlock our
phones and find our friends and family members in photographs; cameras
identify swimmers in trouble in swimming pools and assist people in
driving cars.

With such a large role in society, one may expect that computer vision
mistakes can have a large impact and have the potential to cause harm,
and unfortunately this is true. While self-driving cars may save tens of
thousands of lives each year, mistakes in those algorithms can also lead
to human deaths. A mistaken computer match with a surveillance
photograph may implicate the wrong person in a crime. Furthermore, the
performance of computer vision algorithms can vary from person to
person, sometimes as a function of protected attributes of the person,
such as gender, race, or age. These are potential outcomes that the
computer vision community needs to be aware of and to mitigate.

The field of **Algorithmic Fairness** studies the performance and
fairness of algorithms across people, groups, and cultures. It seeks to
address algorithmic biases, and to develop strategies to ensure that
computer vision algorithms don't reflect or create biases against
different groups of people or cultures. Entry points to this literature
include a number of text and video sources, including
@Kearns2020, @Gebru2020, @Hamidi2018, @Garvie2016, @Hutchinson2019, @Dwork2012, @barocas-hardt-narayanan, @Hardt2020.

We review two topics: fairness and ethics. In , we describe some current
techniques. This is just a small sampling of work in this quickly
evolving area, selected to intersect well with the material in the rest
of this book. There is more literature and more subtleties than can be
covered here. Even if our algorithms and datasets were completely free
of bias, there are still many ethical concerns regarding the use of
computer vision technology. In , we pose ethics questions that we
encourage computer vision researchers to think about.

## Fairness {#sect-fairness}

Modern computer vision algorithms are trained from data, and thus are
influenced by the statistical make-up of the training data. Correlations
between the expressed gender of individuals and their depicted
activities recorded within a dataset can perpetuate or even amplify
societal gender biases captured in the dataset
@Zhao2017, @dalessandro2017, @Noble2018. Gender classification systems
in 2018 showed performance that depended on skin tone @Buolamwini2018.

There is a need for datasets, and the algorithms trained from them, to
minimize spurious relations between protected attributes of people, such
as skin color, age, gender, and the image labels or recognition outputs,
such as occupation or other qualities that should not depend on the
protected attributes. Researchers have begun to develop methods to
identify and mitigate such biases in either computer vision databases or
algorithms.

### Facial Analysis

Facial detection asks whether there is a face in some image region,
while facial analysis refers to measuring additional attributes of the
face, including pose and identity. It is important to characterize the
performance of facial analysis systems across demographic groups, as
certain studies have done @Klare2012. A large Face Recognition Vendor
Test by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
@Grother2019 examined the accuracy of face recognition algorithms for
different demographic groups defined by sex, age, and race or country of
birth. For one dataset, they found false positive rates were highest in
West and East African and East Asian people, and lowest in Eastern
European individuals. For the systems offered by many vendors, this
effect was large, with differences of up to a factor of 100 in the
recognition false positive rates between different countries of birth.
In addition, the more accurate face recognition systems showed less bias
and some developers supplied highly accurate identification algorithms
for which false positive differentials were undetectable. Certain
studies @Grother2019 have stressed the importance of reporting both
false negative and false positive rates for each demographic group at
that threshold. Others @Cavazos2021 have provided a checklist for
measuring bias in face recognition algorithms. It is clearly important
to understand the biases of any facial analysis system that is put into
use, as these characteristics can vary greatly from system to system.

### Dataset Biases

One cause of algorithmic bias can be a bias in the contents of the
training dataset. There are many subtleties in the creation and labeling
of computer vision datasets @Ramaswamy2021b. Any dataset represents only
one slice of the possible images and labels that one could capture from
the world @Torralba2011. Furthermore, the samples taken may well be
influenced by the background of the researchers gathering the dataset.
shows examples of common objects from four different households across
the globe. From left to right, the photographs are shown in decreasing
order of the average household income of the region from which the photo
was taken. The object recognition results for six different commercially
available image recognition systems are listed below each photograph,
showing that the performance is much better for the images from
first-world households @DeVries2019, possibly due to a better
representation of imagery from such households in the training datasets
of the image recognition systems.

@fig-soap shows images of household items, and their recognized classes by
five object recognition systems . The systems tend to perform worse for
non-Western countries and for lower-income households, such as those of
the right two photographs.

### Generative Adversarial Networks to Create Unbiased Datasets and Algorithms

One way to mitigate a biased dataset is to synthetically produce the
images needed to provide the necessary balance or coverage. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs), described in , can operate on a dataset to
generate sets of images similar to those of the dataset, but differing
from each other in controlled ways, for example, with changes in the
apparent gender, age, or race of depicted people. Such GANs have been
used to develop debiased datasets and algorithms.

Sattigeri et al. @Sattigeri2019 proposed an algorithm they called
Fairness GAN, which included a classifier trained to perform *as poorly
as possible* on predicting the classification result based on a
protected attribute. For example, the algorithm was designed to predict
an attractiveness label while gaining no benefit from knowing the gender
or skin tone. The resulting debiased dataset showed some improvement in
fairness metrics.

Another study @Ramaswamy2021 took an alternative approach to the problem
of removing correlations between a protected attribute and a target
label. The authors used GANs to generate pairs of realistic looking
images that were balanced with respect to each protected attribute.
shows an example of this. If "wearing hat" is deemed to be the protected
attribute, it is desired to remove its correlation in the data with the
attribute, "wearing glasses." If no debiasing steps were taken, the
algorithm would learn to associate wearing hats with wearing glasses.
The GAN is used to augment the dataset with paired examples of images of
people wearing hats both with and without glasses. When this augmented
dataset is combined with the original dataset, performance in a variety
of fairness measures is improved.

Still another approach to dataset fairness, by @Zhao2017, injects
constraints to require that the model predictions follow the
distributions observed within the training data, assuming that the
training data has the desired distribution. See also @Wang2020 for a
benchmark and comparison of techniques for dataset bias mitigation.



![In this example “wears hat” is deemed to be a protected
attribute, but it is correlated with another attribute, which in this
example is “wears glasses” @Ramaswamy2021. The GAN-based method generates sets of
images where wearing hats is not correlated with wearing
glasses.](figures/fairness/augmentation.jpg){#fig-augmentation}


### Counterfactuals for Analyzing Algorithmic Biases

It may be difficult to distinguish whether a given biased result is
caused by algorithmic bias or by biases in the testing dataset
@Balakrishnan2020. One way to disentangle those is through
experimentation, that is, modifying variables of a probe image and
examining the algorithm's decision. GAN models, when coupled with human
labeling to learn directions in the latent space corresponding to
changes in the desired attributes, allow for such experimental
intervention. Researchers @Balakrishnan2020 have shown that such
counterfactual studies may lead to very different conclusions than
observational studies alone, which can be influenced by biased
correlations in the testing dataset. (See also related work in
counterfactual reasoning by @Denton2019.) shows several **transects**
from @Balakrishnan2020, paths through the GAN's latent space where only
one face variable is modified. The variation in an algorithm's
classification results along the images of the transect provides a
clean assessment of any bias related to the variable being modified.

### Privacy and Differential Privacy

Since progress in computer vision often comes via new datasets, which
typically show images and activities of people, issues of privacy are
very important in computer vision research. There are many ways in which
people can be harmed by either intentional or unintentional
participation in a dataset. Datasets of medical results, financial
transactions, views of public places, all can contain information that
must remain private. Conversely, there is a benefit to society of
releasing datasets for researchers to study: associations can be found
that will benefit public health or safety. Consequently, subjects want
researchers to work with anonymized versions of their datasets.
Unfortunately, a number of well-known examples have shown that seemingly
cleaned data, when combined with another apparently innocuous dataset,
can reveal information that was desired to be private. For example, in
1997, the medical records of the governor of Massachussetts were
identified by matching anonymized medical data with publicly available
voter registration records @Kearns2020, @Dwork2014. 

The combination of the two datasets allowed seemingly de-identified private data to be re-identified.

::: {.margin-note}
**Differential privacy** allows extracting aggregated information about a population from a database without revealing information about any single individual.
:::

A very successful theoretical privacy framework, called differential
privacy, addresses these issues. Following the techniques of
differential privacy @Dwork2014 researchers can guarantee to the
participants of a study that they will not be affected by allowing their
data to be used in a study or analysis, no matter what other studies,
datasets, or information sources are available.

Algorithms can be designed for which it can be shown that the guarantee
of differential privacy is met @Kearns2020, @Dwork2014. One approach is
to inject enough randomness into each recorded observation to guarantee
that no individual's data can be reconstructed (with probabilistic
guarantees that can be made as stringent as desired, at the cost of data
efficiency), while still allowing scientific conclusions to be formed by
averaging over the many data samples. A simple example of this approach,
described in @Kearns2020, is the following procedure to query a set of
adults to determine what fraction of them have cheated on their partner.
Each surveyed adult is instructed to flip a coin. If the coin shows
heads, they are instructed to answer the question, "Have you cheated on
your partner?", truthfully. If the coin shows tails, they are asked to
answer "yes" or "no" at random, by flipping the coin again and answering
"yes" if heads and "no" if tails. The resulting responses for each
individual are stored.

::: {.column-margin}
There are also risks associated with the wrong use of differential privacy @Dwork_Kohli_Mulligan_2019.
:::

If the stored data were hacked, or accidentally leaked, no harm would
come to the surveyed individuals even though their data from this
sensitive survey had been revealed. Any "yes\" answer could very
plausibly be explained as being a result of the subject having been
instructed by the protocol to flip a coin to select the answer. Yet it
is still possible to infer the true percentage of "yes\" answers in the
surveyed population from the stored data: the expected value of the
measured percentages will be the true "yes\" and "no\" answers in the
population. The price for this differential privacy is that more data
must be collected to obtain the same accuracy guarantees in the estimate
of the true population averages.



## Ethics {#sect-ethics}

Many ethical issues are outside of the traditional training and
education of scientists or engineers, but ethics are important for
vision scientists to think through and grapple with. Scientists have a
distinguished history of engaging with ethical and moral issues
@Huxley1932, @Orwell1948, @Kearns2020, @Rogaway2015.

### Concerns beyond Algorithmic Bias

Suppose the research community developed algorithms that could recognize
and analyze people or objects equally well, regardless of displayed
gender, race, age, culture or other class attributes. Is the community's
work toward fairness completed? Unfortunately, there are still many
issues of concern, as pointed out by many authors and speakers
@Gebru2020, @Gebru2021, @Benjamin2019. To list a few of these issues:

-   Face analysis for job hiring. Companies have used automated facial
    analysis methods (analyzing expressions and length of responses) as
    part of their proprietary algorithms for resume screening, although,
    at least for some cases, that process has stopped after criticism of
    the fairness of these methods for screening @Kahn2021.

-   Automated identification of faces can be used to compile a list of
    the participants at a public protest, potentially allowing
    retribution for attendance @Garvie2016, @Mozur2019.

-   People can show a bias toward believing the output of a machine
    @Cummings2004, making it more difficult for a person to correct an
    algorithm's mistake.

-   There are concerns whether labeling the gender of a person from
    their appearance could cause distress or harm to some in the LGBTQ
    community @Hamidi2018, @Bennett2021.

We provide a subsequent list of questions for thought and discussion. We
encourage computer vision students and practitioners to engage with
these questions, and, of course, to continue to ask their own questions
as well. We need to work both as technologists and as citizens to ensure
that computer vision technologies are used responsibly.

### Some Ethical Issues in Computer Vision

The following are an (incomplete) set of questions that researchers and
engineers may keep in mind:

-   Would you prefer that a person identify someone from a photograph,
    with the potential biases and assumptions that the individual may
    have, or for an algorithm to do so, based on training from a dataset
    which may include biases of its own? See
    @Kearns2020, @Mullainathan2019 for related discussions.

-   What privacy safeguards must be in place to accept always-on camera
    and voice recording inside people's homes? Inside your own home?

-   Traffic fatalities in the US currently result in the tragedy of
    approximately 30,000 deaths annually, with most of those fatalities
    being caused by driver error. If every vehicle were self-driving,
    fatalities caused by human error could fall dramatically, yet there
    will surely still be fatalities caused by machine errors, albeit far
    fewer than had been caused by humans. Is that a tradeoff society
    should make? What should be our threshold of fatalities caused by
    machine? This moral question is a societal-scale version of "the
    trolley problem" @Thomson1985: A bystander can choose to divert a
    trolley from the main track to a side track, saving five people who
    are on that main track, but killing one person who is on the side
    track. Should the bystander actively divert the trolley,
    intentionally killing the person on the side track, who would
    otherwise have been spared if no action were taken? These issues are
    also present for automobile airbags, which save many lives but
    sometimes injure a small number of people @Dalmotas1995, and in
    other public health issues.

-   Algorithms will never perform exactly as well among all groups of
    people. Within what tolerance must the performance of human analysis
    algorithms be for an algorithm to be considered fair? Is algorithmic
    bias being less than human bias sufficient for deployment?

-   Some image datasets have contained offensive material
    @Birhand2021, @Barber2019. How should we decide which concepts or
    images can be part of a training set? Is there any need for
    algorithms to understand offensive words or concepts?

-   Could potential categorization tasks of humans in photographs (e.g.,
    gender identity, skincolor, age, height) bring harm to individuals,
    and how?

-   Should computer vision systems ever be used in warfare? In policing?
    In public surveillance?

-   What is the role of machines in society? Regarding decisions of
    person identification, do we want people making decisions, with
    their own difficult-to-measure biases, or do we want machines
    involved, with biases that may be measurable?

-   Do face recognition algorithms suppress public protests? Consider a
    world where any face shown in public is always recorded and
    identifiable. (We are almost in that world). What are the
    consequences of that for personal safety, speech, assembly, and
    liberties?

-   What are the most beneficial uses of computer vision?

-   Which uses have the most potential for harm, or currently cause the
    most harm?

-   Is it ok to use computer vision to monitor workers in order to
    improve their productivity? In order to improve workplace safety? In
    order to prevent workplace harassment?

-   What criteria would you use to evaluate the pros and cons of using
    machines or humans for a given task?

-   Should datasets represent real-world disparities, or represent the
    world as we want it to be? How might these choices amplify existing
    economic disparities?

-   When should consent be required (and from whom) before using an
    image to train a computer vision algorithm?

## Concluding Remarks

Computer vision, with its expanding roles in society, can both cause
harm as well as bring many benefits. It is important that every computer
vision researcher be aware of the potentials for harm, as well as learn
techniques to mitigate against those possibilities. It is our
responsibility to bring this technology into our society with care and
understanding.
