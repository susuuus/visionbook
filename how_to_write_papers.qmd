# How to Write Papers {#sec-how_to_write_papers}

## Introduction

An important part of research is communicating your results to others,
so we include our thoughts about how to write good papers. A video
presentation of material related to this chapter is @FreemanPapers2020.

Many graduate students we know feel it is important to coauthor many
papers. While the number of papers a student has can be a rough measure
of research productivity, it is our experience as mentors, faculty
search committee members, and industrial research managers that *only
the good papers count*. (We acknowledge that this is not true
everywhere, and some institutions simply count papers. But you should
still strive to make all your papers good!) This emphasis is shown in
@fig-impact, a plot of made-up data that summarizes our impression,
formed over many years, of the relationship between paper quality and
its impact on one's career. Only the really good papers matter for your
career. So it makes sense to learn how to write the best possible paper
from any given piece of research work.

## Organization

The Ph.D. thesis advisor of two of us, Prof. Edward Adelson, wrote some
good advice in response to a student's question of how to write a good
paper @Adelson92:

-   Start by stating which problem you are addressing, keeping the
    audience in mind. They must care about it, which means that
    sometimes you must tell them why they should care about the problem.

-   Then state briefly what the other solutions are to the problem, and
    why they aren't satisfactory. If they were satisfactory, you
    wouldn't need to do the work.

-   Then explain your own solution, compare it with other solutions, and
    say why it's better.

-   At the end, talk about related work where similar techniques and
    experiments have been used, but applied to a different problem.

That structure fits well with a progression of section headings typical
of many conference papers. As an example, here are the headings from
paper @Fergus2006, coauthored by one of us. The structure is useful for
many research papers:

  ----- ----------------------------------------
  1\.   Introduction
  2\.   Related work
  3\.   Main idea
  4\.   Algorithm
        4.1 Estimating the blur kernel
            4.1.1 Multiscale approach
            4.1.2 User supervision
        4.2 Image reconstruction
  5\.   Experiments
        5.1 Small blurs
        5.2 Large blurs
        5.3 Images with significant saturation
  6\.   Discussion
  ----- ----------------------------------------

### The Paper's Introduction

Regarding paper introductions, Kajiya @Kajiya1993 writes, "You must make
your paper easy to read. You've got to make it easy for anyone to tell
what your paper is about, what problem it solves, why the problem is
interesting, what is really new in your paper (and what isn't), why it's
so neat. And you must do it up front. In other words, you must write a
dynamite introduction."

### Main Idea

When appropriate to the paper, it can be very helpful to show a simple
example that captures the main idea of the paper. Here is a figure from
a different paper @Simoncelli92 that conveys the main idea very simply.
The paper's main idea was that wavelets lacked important desirable
features for an image representation. @fig-wavelet shows the failure of
a wavelet representation to form a translation invariant representation.
The top row shows two versions of the same signal, differing only in a
one-sample translation. The bottom three rows show the coefficients of
the high-, mid-, and low-frequency bands of a wavelet representation of
that signal. The figure points out in a simple way the drawback of a
wavelet representation with aliased subbands that was the focus of the
paper: as the signal translates, the signal representation energy moves
to different frequency bands and changes form within the mid-frequency
band.


![Effect of translation on the wavelet representation of a signal  (caption and figure after @Simoncelli92.  (a) An input signal.  (b-d) The high-, mid-, and low-frequency coefficients within a wavelet subband decomposition.  (e) The same input signal, translated one sample to the right.  (fâ€“h) The decomposition of the shifted signal into the same three bands.  Note the drastic change in the transform coefficients induced by the shift.](figures/papers/wavelet2.png){width="65%" #fig-wavelet}

### Experimental Results

In earlier days of computer vision research, good ideas could be
presented with only plausibility arguments to support them. However,
modern standards require that assertions in a paper be backed up with
experimental evidence. Readers will be expecting a table quantitatively
comparing the performance of your algorithm with that of the previous
state-of-the-art. If you are proposing a new task for which there aren't
previous benchmarks, you should still compare with an algorithm that
solves a related task, noting that the algorithm was designed for a
different task.

![prototypical table of results, from \cite{Owens2016}  Rows are different algorithms, or ablations of a favored algorithm. Columns are datasets or tasks, and the numbers indicate performance, with the best performances given in bold.](figures/papers/resultTable.png){width="75%" #fig-resultTable}

### How to End the Paper

A cautionary note on how *not* to end the paper. Conference papers are
often written under deadline pressure, and there is inevitably a list of
results that the authors wanted to obtain that have been left
uncompleted. You should resist the temptation to describe the items that
were left unfinished in a section on "Future Work." It is hard to
imagine a weaker way to end the paper than to enumerate all the things
the paper doesn't accomplish, providing a summary of where it falls
short.

Instead, the paper can finish with a review what has been presented,
emphasizing the contributions. How has the world changed, now that the
reader has read this paper? What new research directions have been
opened up; what can we do now that we couldn't do before?

## General Writing Tips

Donald Knuth, the author of the classic book series, *The Art of
Computer Programming*, wrote @Knuth1989,"Perhaps the most important
principle of good writing is to keep the reader uppermost in mind: What
does the reader know so far? What does the reader expect next and why?"

Our mental image is that of a great host, who anticipates every need of
their house guest: after you arrive, they say, "Can I take your coat?
Would you like something to drink?" At every moment, they know what you
might be wanting and how to help you find it.

### Use Fewer Words

In *The Elements of Style* @Strunk, Strunk and White write, "Vigorous
writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a
paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing
should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts."

To make this point in the context of scientific writing, the following
is a paragraph that one of the authors of this textbook wrote with a
student.

> The underlying assumption of this work is that the estimate of a given
> node will only depend on nodes within a patch: this is a locality
> assumption imposed at the patch-level. This assumption can be
> justified in case of skin images since a pixel in one corner of the
> image is likely to have small effect on a different pixel far away
> from itself. Therefore, we can crop the image into smaller windows, as
> shown in Figure 5, and compute the inverse J matrix of the cropped
> window. Since the cropped window is much smaller than the input image,
> the inversion of J matrix is computationally cheaper. Since we are
> inferring on blocks of image patches (i.e., ignoring pixels outside of
> the cropped window), the interpolated image will have blocky
> artifacts. Therefore, only part of xMAP is used to interpolate the
> image, as shown in Figure 5.

While the text above conveys the desired technical information, it
describes things in a roundabout way. The word count is 149. Below, the
paragraph has been rewritten to just 88 words without changing its
meaning.

Note that writing more concise text helps your paper in two ways. First,
researchers are typically fighting against a page limit, particularly in
conference submissions, so tighter text lets the author say more or add
another figure. Second, concise text is usually clearer and easier to
understand.

### Title, Figure Captions, and Equations

While we may imagine our reader reading every word of our paper, in our
current era of many published papers, most of your readers will probably
only skim your paper. We suspect that the engagement of readers with
your paper will look something as shown in @fig-engagement.

![The conjectured readership of a computer science paper (conjectured relative amounts).  Many people will read the title, but far fewer will read the abstract or look at the figures.  Fewer still will read every word of the paper.  You should allow readers to access your paper at each level of engagement.](figures/papers/readership.png){width="50%" #fig-engagement}

If only because that is where most of your readership lies, you should
write your paper so that readers will learn from it, even at those
reduced levels of engagement. The title should convey the top-level
message of the paper. The figures and their captions should be
self-contained and tell the story of the paper. The abstract should
provide a good summary.

A good title can generate attention and interest for the paper. "What
makes Paris look like Paris" @doersch2012what is a delightful paper, and
the title lets the reader see that right away. In contrast, one of us
coauthored a paper called "Shiftable Multi-scale Transforms." While that
title is appropriate, it's not catchy. After the paper was in print, we
realized that we should have added the subtitle, "What's wrong with
wavelets?" --- a catchy phrase that tells the main point of the paper.

Because you can assume that many of the readers of your figure captions
will not be reading the full paper, *the captions should be
self-contained*. They should point out what readers are supposed to
notice about the figure, to help both the full-paper reader and the
figures-only reader. @fig-shapetime shows an example.

![Figure and caption from \cite{FreemanShapetime}. The caption should be understandable by itself, and should point to what the reader should take away from the figure.](figures/papers/shapetimeFig.jpg){width="55%" #fig-shapetime}

Equations interposed with text can pose a challenge to the reader. Does
the reader stop to work through each equation, or continue reading as
quickly as if the equation were words? Knuth @Knuth1989 and Mermin
@Mermin1989 both give advice on writing with equations. Knuth writes,
"*Many readers will skim over formulas on their first reading of your
exposition. Therefore, your sentences should flow smoothly when all but
the simplest formulas are replaced by 'blah' or some other grunting
noise.*"

Mermin adds,"*When referring to an equation identify it by a phrase as
well as a number. No compassionate and helpful person would herald the
arrival of Eq. (7.38) by saying 'inserting (2.47 and (3.51 into
(5.13)\...' when it is possible to say 'inserting the form (2.47 of the
electric field $E$ and the Lindhard form (3.51) of the dielectric
function $\epsilon$ into the constitutive equation (5.13)\...'* "

### Tone

The tone of your writing is important. You may feel pressure to
oversell, hide drawbacks, and disparage others' work. It is in both your
short-term and your long-term interest not to succumb to that pressure!
If your work has a shortcoming, it is much better that you point it out
than to have someone else do so later.

Papers written from the point of view that "we're all good researchers,
doing our best" are much more pleasant to read than papers written from
the standpoint that everyone else is an idiot. Note the delightful
sentences written by Efros @Efros01 when he was a graduate student, "*A
number of papers to be published this year, all developed independently,
are closely related to our work. The idea of texture transfer based on
variations of \[6\] has been proposed by several authors (in particular,
see the elegant paper by Hertzmann et al. in these proceedings). Liang
et al. propose a real-time patch-based texture synthesis method very
similar to ours. The reader is urged to review these works for a more
complete picture of the field.*" This generous tone wins over the reader
and promotes long-lasting friendships with people who study the same
problems you do.

You should develop a reputation for being clear and reliable. Always
convey an accurate impression of the performance of an algorithm. If
something doesn't work in important cases, let the readers know. In
@Fergus2006, we noted that our deblurring algorithm didn't work for a
case where we had been sure it should work for a maximum a posteriori
(MAP) estimation of the deblurred image. Some years later we learned,
and described in @Levin2011, that we had been wrong to believe that MAP
estimation of the deblurred image was feasible. We were glad we had
described our counterintuitive result years before.

### Author List

The quality of the papers you write matters so much more than your
positions within the author lists of the papers. If adding more authors
will make a paper better, then you should add more authors. If a
collaborator feels they should be an author, but you yourself are not
sure, we find it is generally a good idea to trust the collaborator and
to add them as a coauthor. It's much better to be one of many authors on
a great paper than to be one of just a few authors on a mediocre paper.

### Avoiding Rejection

With the task of rejecting at least three-quarters of the submissions,
conference area chairs, who make the acceptance decisions, are grasping
for reasons to reject a paper. Here's a summary of reasons that are
commonly used, and it is best not to provide the area chair with any of
these easy reasons to reject your paper:

-   Do the authors not deliver what they promise?

-   Are important references missing (and therefore one suspects the
    authors not up on the state of the art for this problem)?

-   Are the results too incremental (too similar to previous work)?

-   Are the results believable, with sufficient tests to support the
    claims?

-   Is the paper poorly written?

-   Are there mistakes or incorrect statements?

As an area chair, the very good and the very bad papers are easy to deal
with, and most of the decision-making effort goes to the borderline
papers. One of us writes, "I find that much of my time is spent dealing
with two kinds of borderline papers: cockroaches and puppies with six
toes."

"Cockroaches" have no exciting contributions, but the reviews are ok and
the results show incremental improvement to the state of the art.
They're hard to kill (hence the nickname), and maybe two-thirds are
accepted as posters, and one-third are rejected. As an author, it's best
to work harder for the fresh results, to bring papers like this out of
the cockroach category.

At the other end of the spectrum of borderline papers are "puppies with
six toes." These are delightful papers, but with an easy-to-see flaw.
The flaw may not matter (like six toes on a puppy) but makes the paper
easy to reject, even though the paper may be fresh and wonderful. Maybe
two-thirds of those papers get rejected, and one-third maybe accepted as
posters. As an author, it may be better to wait for another submission
cycle with a paper like this, to remove the easy to spot flaw. Then the
paper might receive an oral presentation at a subsequent conference
submission cycle.

## Concluding Remarks

The approaches to writing and editing described previously all take
time: good writing involves lots of rewriting. We find that the last
days before a paper submission deadline are often better spent improving
the structure, presentation, and clarity of the paper than in trying to
obtain last-minute improvements to the results.
