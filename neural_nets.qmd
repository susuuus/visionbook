# Neural Networks {#sec-neural_nets}

## Introduction

Neural networks are functions loosely modeled on the brain. In the
brain, we have billions of neurons that connect to one another. Each
neuron can be thought of as a node in a graph, and the edges are the
connections from one neuron to the next (@fig-neural_nets-fig1_net). The
edges are directed; electrical signals propagate in just one direction
along the wires in the brain.

![A neural network can be drawn as a directed graph.](figures/neural_nets/fig1_net.png){#fig-neural_nets-fig1_net width=30%}

Outgoing edges are called axons and incoming edges are called dendrites.
A neuron fires, sending a pulse down its axon, when the incoming pulses,
from the dendrites, exceed a threshold.

## The Perceptron: A Simple Model of a Single Neuron

Let's consider a neuron, shaded in gray, that has four inputs and one
output (@fig-neural_nets-perceptron_fig2).


![A simple model for a neuron is the perceptron.](figures/neural_nets/perceptron_fig2.png){#fig-neural_nets-perceptron_fig2 width=30%}

A simple model for this neuron is the . A perceptron is a neuron with
$n$ inputs $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and one output $y$, that maps inputs to
outputs according to the following equations: 
$$\begin{aligned}
z = f(\mathbf{x}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i + b = \mathbf{w}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{x} + b &\triangleleft \quad \text{linear layer}\\
    g(z) &= \begin{cases}
    1, &\text{if} \quad z > 0\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} &\triangleleft \quad \text{activation function}\\
    y &= g(f(\mathbf{x})) &\triangleleft \quad \text{perceptron}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-neural_nets-perceptron_activation}

In words, we take a weighted sum of the inputs and, if that sum exceeds
a threshold (here 0), the neuron fires (outputs a 1). The function $f$
is called a because it computes a linear function of the inputs,
$\mathbf{w}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{x}$, plus a **bias**, b. The function $g$
is called the because it decides whether the neuron activates (fires).

:::{.column-margin}
Mathematically, $f$ is an affine function, but by convention we call it a "linear layer." One way to think of it is $f$ is a linear function of $\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{x}\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$.

### The Perceptron as a Classifier

People got excited about perceptrons in the late 1950s because it was
shown that they can learn to classify data @rosenblatt1958perceptron.
Let's see how that works. We will consider a perceptron with two inputs,
$x_1$ and $x_2$, and one output, $y$. Let the incoming connection
weights be $w_1 = 2$, $w_2 = 1$, and $b=0$. The values of $z$ and $y$,
as a function of $x_1$ and $x_2$, are shown in @fig-neural_nets-perceptron_as_classifier.

\caption{Value of hidden unit ($z$) and output unit ($y$) in a perceptron, as a function of the input data.}
\label{fig-neural_nets-perceptron_as_classifier}

![Value of hidden unit ($z$) and output unit ($y$) in a perceptron, as a function of the input data.](figures/neural_nets/perceptron_as_classifier.png){#fig-neural_nets-perceptron_as_classifier}

Notice that $y$ takes on values 0 or 1, so you can think of this as a
classifier that assigns a class label of 1 to the upper-right half of
the plotted region.

### Learning with a Perceptron

So a perceptron acts like a classifier, but how can we use it to learn?
The idea is that given data, $\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N$, we
will adjust the weights $\mathbf{w}$ and the bias $b$, in order to
minimize a classification loss, $\mathcal{L}$, that scores number of
misclassifications: 

$$\begin{aligned}    \mathbf{w}^*, b^* = \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b, y^{(i)})
\end{aligned}$${#eq-neural_nets-perceptron_learning_problem} 

In @fig-neural_nets-fitting_a_perceptron, this
optimization process corresponds to shifting and rotating the **decision
boundary**, until you find a line that separates data labeled as $y = 0$
from data labeled as $y = 1$.

\caption{Different possible decision surfaces of a perceptron.}
\label{fig-neural_nets-fitting_a_perceptron}

![Different possible decision surfaces of a perceptron.](figures/neural_nets/fitting_a_perceptron.png){#fig-neural_nets-fitting_a_perceptron}

You might be wondering, what's the exact optimization algorithm that
will find the best line that separates the classes? The original
perceptron paper proposed one particular algorithm, the "perceptron
learning algorithm." This was an optimizer tailored to the specific
structure of the perceptron. Older papers on neural nets are full of
specific learning rules for specific architectures: the delta rule, the
Rescorla-Wagner model, and so forth @rescorla1972theory. Nowadays we
rarely use these special-purpose algorithms. Instead, we use
*general-purpose* optimizers like gradient descent (for differentiable
objectives) or zeroth-order methods (for nondifferentiable objectives).
The next chapter will cover the backpropagation algorithm, which is a
general-purpose gradient-based optimizer that applies to essentially all
neural networks we will see in this book (but, note that for the
perceptron objective, because it has a nondifferentiable threshold
function, we would instead opt for a zeroth order optimizer).

## Multilayer Perceptrons

Perceptrons can solve linearly separable binary classification problems,
but they are otherwise rather limited. For one, they only produce a
single output. What if we want multiple outputs? We can achieve this by
adding edges that fan out after the perceptron
(@fig-neural_nets-fan_out).

![Multiple outputs fan out from a neuron.](figures/neural_nets/fan_out.png){#fig-neural_nets-fan_out width=30%}


This network maps an input **layer** of data $\mathbf{x}$ to a layer of
outputs **y**. The neurons in between inputs and outputs are called
**hidden units**, shaded in gray. Here, $z$ is a hidden unit and $h$ is
a hidden unit, that is, $h = g(z)$ where $g(\cdot)$ is an activation
function like in @eq-neural_nets-perceptron_activation.

More commonly we might have many hidden units in stack, which we call a
(@fig-neural_nets-MLP1).


![Mutilayer perceptron.](figures/neural_nets/MLP1.png){#fig-neural_nets-MLP1 width=30%}

:::{.column-margin}
How many layers does this net have? Some texts will say two [$\mathbf{W}_1$, $\mathbf{W}_2$], others three [$\mathbf{x}$, $\{\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{h}\}$, $\mathbf{y}$], others four [$\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{z}$, $\mathbf{h}$, $\mathbf{y}$]. We must get comfortable with the ambiguity.
:::

Because this network has multiple layers of neurons, and because each
neuron in this net acts as a perceptron, we call it a **multilayer
perceptron** (**MLP**). The equation for this MLP is: 
$$\begin{aligned}    \mathbf{z} &= \mathbf{W}_1\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1 &\triangleleft \quad \text{linear layer}\\
    \mathbf{h} &= g(\mathbf{z}) &\triangleleft \quad \text{activation function}\\
    \mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{W}_2\mathbf{h} + \mathbf{b}_2 &\triangleleft \quad \text{linear layer}
\end{aligned}$$

In general, MLPs can be constructed with any number of layers following this pattern: linear layer, activation function, linear layer, activation function, and so on.

The activation function $g$ could be the threshold function like in
@eq-neural_nets-perceptron_activation, but more generally it can be any
pointwise nonlinearity, that is, $g(\mathbf{h}) = [\tilde{g}(h_1), \ldots, \tilde{g}(h_N)]$ and $\tilde{g}$ is any nonlinear function that maps $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

Beyond MLPs, this kind of sequence (linear layer, pointwise
nonlinearity, linear layer, pointwise nonlinearity, and so on) is the
prototpyical motif in almost all neural networks, including most we will
see later in this book.

## Activations Versus Parameters

When working with deep nets it's useful to distinguish *activations* and
*parameters*. The activations are the values that the neurons take on,
$[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}_1, \mathbf{h}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{z}_{L-1}, \mathbf{h}_{L-1}, \mathbf{y}]$;
slightly abusing notation, we use this term for both preactivation
function neurons and postactivation function neurons. The activations
are the neural representations of the data being processed. Often, we
will not worry about distinguishing between inputs, hidden units, and
outputs to the net, and simply refer to all data and neural activations
in a network, layer by layer, as a sequence
$[\mathbf{x}_0, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_L]$, in which case $\mathbf{x}_0$ is
the raw input data

:::{.column-margin}
![A multilayer network is a sequence of transformations $f_1, \ldots, f_L$ that produce a series of activations $\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_L$.](figures/neural_nets/transformations.png){width=30%}
:::

Conversely, parameters are the weights and biases of the network. These
are the variables being learned. Both activations and parameters are
tensors of variables.

Often we think of a layer as a function
$\mathbf{x}_{l+1} = f_{l+1}(\mathbf{x}_l)$, but we can also make the
parameters explicit and think of each layer as a function:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{x}_{l+1} = f_{l+1}(\mathbf{x}_{l}, \theta_{l+1})
\end{aligned}$$ 

That is, each layer takes the activations from the
previous layer, as well as parameters of the current layer as input, and
produces activations of the next layer. Varying either the input
activations or the input parameters will affect the output of the layer.
From this perspective, anything we can do with parameters, we can do
with activations instead, and vice versa, and that is the basis for a
lot of applications and tricks. For example, while normally we learn the
values of the parameters, we could instead hold the parameters fixed and
learn the values of the activations that achieve some objective. In
fact, this is what is done in many methods such as network prompting,
adversarial attacks, and network visualization, which we will see in
more detail in later chapters.

### Fast Activations and Slow Parameters

So what's different about activations versus parameters? One way to
think about it is that activations are *fast* functions of a
data*point*: they are the result of a few layers of processing this
datapoint. Parameters are *also* functions of the data (they are learned
from data) but they are *slow* functions of data*sets*: the parameters
are arrived at via an optimization procedure over a whole dataset. So,
both activations and parameters are statistics of the data, that is,
information extracted about about the data that organizes or summarizes
it. The parameters are a kind of metasummary since they specify a
functional transformation that produces activations from data, and
activations themselves are a summary of the data.
@fig-neural_nets-params_vs_activations shows how this looks.

![Learning is a function that maps a dataset to parameters. Inference, through a neural net, is a function that maps a datapoint to activations.](figures/neural_nets/params_vs_activations.png){#fig-neural_nets-params_vs_activations width=80%}

## Deep Nets

Deep nets are neural nets that stack the linear-nonlinear motif many
times (@fig-deep_nets):


![Deep nets consist of linear layers interleaved with nonlinearities.](figures/neural_nets/deep_nets.png){#fig-deep_nets}

Each layer is a function. Therefore, a deep net is a composition of many
functions: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    f(\mathbf{x}) = f_{L}(f_{L-1}(\ldots f_2(f_1(\mathbf{x}))))
\end{aligned}$$

:::{.column-margin}
The $L$ is the number of layers in the net.
:::

These functions are parameterized by weights $[\mathbf{W}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{W}_L]$ and biases $[\mathbf{b}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{b}_L]$. Some layers we will see later have other parameters. Collectively, we will refer to the concatenation of all the parameters in a deep net as $\theta$.

Deep nets are powerful because they can perform nonlinear mappings. In
fact, a deep net with sufficiently many neurons can fit almost any
desired function arbitrarily closely, a property we will investigate
further in @sec-neural_nets-universal_approximation.

### Deep Nets Can Perform Nonlinear Classification

Let's return to our binary classification problem shown previously, but
now let's make the two classes not linearly separable. Our new dataset
is shown in @fig-neural_nets-nonseparable_dataset.


![Dataset that is not linearly separable.](figures/neural_nets/nonseparable_dataset.png){#fig-neural_nets-nonseparable_dataset width=40%}

Here there is no line that can separate the zeros from the ones.
Nonetheless, we will demonstrate a multilayer network that can solve
this problem. The trick is to just add more layers! We will use the two
layer MLP shown in @fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network.


![A simple MLP network.](figures/neural_nets/simple_MLP_network.png){#fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network width=40%}

Consider using the following settings for $\mathbf{W}_1$ and
$\mathbf{W}_2$: $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{W}_1 = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
            -1 & 1 \\
            1 & 2
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\quad\quad
    \mathbf{W}_2 = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & -1
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}$$ The full net then performs the following operation:
$$\begin{aligned}
    z_1 &= x_1 - x_2, \quad z_2 = 2x_1 + x_2 &\triangleleft \quad \texttt{linear}\\
    h_1 &= \max(z_1,0), \quad h_2 = \max(z_2,0) &\triangleleft \quad \texttt{relu}\\
    z_3 &= h_1-h_2 &\triangleleft \quad \texttt{linear}\\
    y &= \mathbb{1}(z_3 > 0) &\triangleleft \quad \text{\texttt{threshold}}
\end{aligned}$$  



::: {.column-margin}
The $\mathbb{1}$ is the indicator function, which we define as: 
$$\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{1}(x) = \begin{cases}
                1 & \text{if $x$ is true} \\
                0 & \text{otherwise}
             \end{cases}
\end{equation*}$$
:::

Here we have introduced a new pointwise
nonlinearity, the **Rectified linear unit** (**relu**), which is like a
graded version of a threshold function, and has the advantage that it
yields non-zero gradients over half its domain, thus being amenable to
gradient-based learning.

We visualize the values that the neurons take on as a function of $x_1$
and $x_2$ in @fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network_values:


![Values of hidden units and output unit for the MLP shown in \fig{\ref{fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network}}.](figures/neural_nets/simple_MLP_network_values.png){#fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network_values}


As can be seen in the rightmost plot, at the output $y$, this neural net
successfully assigns a value of 1 to the region of the dataspace where
the datapoints labeled as 1 live. This example demonstrates that is
possible to solve nonlinear classification problems with a deep net. In
practice, we would want to *learn* the parameter settings that achieve
this classification. One way to do so would be to enumerate all possible
parameter settings and pick one that successfully separates the zeros
from the ones. This kind of exhaustive enumeration is a slow process,
but don't worry, in @sec-backpropagation we will see how to speed things up using gradient descent. But it's worth remarking that enumeration is always a sufficient solution, at least when the possible parameter values form a finite set.

### Deep Nets Are Universal Approximators {#sec-neural_nets-universal_approximation}

Not only can deep nets perform nonlinear classification, they can in
principle perform *any* continuous input-output mapping. The **universal approximation theorem** @Cybenko1989 states that this is true even for a network with just a
single hidden layer. The caveat is that the number of neurons in the
hidden layers will have to be very large in order to fit complicated
functions.


:::{.column-margin}
Technically, this theorem only holds for continuous functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N$ -- for example a neural net cannot fit noncomputable functions. We will not be rigorous in this section. We direct the reader to @telgarsky2016benefits for a formal treatment of universal approximation.
:::

To get an intuition for why this is true, we will consider the case of
approximating an arbitrary function from
$\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with a relu-MLP (an MLP with relu
nonlinearities). First observe that any function can be approximated
arbitrarily well by a sum of indicator functions, that is, bumps placed
at different positions: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    f(x) \approx \sum_i w_i \mathbb{1}(\alpha_i < x < \beta_i)
\end{aligned}$${#eq-neural_nets-sum_of_indicators} 

As an example, in @fig-neural_nets-curve_as_bump we
show a curve (blue line) approximated in this way. As the width,
$\beta-\alpha$, of the bumps (black lines) goes to zero, the error in
the fit goes to zero.

![Any function from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ can be approximated arbitrarily well by a sum of elementary bumps.](figures/neural_nets/curve_as_bump.png){#fig-neural_nets-curve_as_bump width=50%}


:::{.column-margin}
While we only consider scalar functions $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ here, a similar construction can be used to approximate general functions of the form $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$.
:::

Next we will show that a relu-MLP can represent
@eq-neural_nets-sum_of_indicators. The weighted sum $\sum_i w_i \ldots$
is the easy part: that's just a linear layer. So we just have to show
that we can also write $\mathbb{1}(\alpha < x < \beta)$ using linear
and relu layers. 

It turns out the construction is rather simple:
$$\begin{aligned}
&\mathbb{1}(\alpha < x < \beta)\\
&\approx \\
&\texttt{relu}\bigg(\frac{x-(\alpha-\gamma)}{\gamma}\bigg) - \texttt{relu}\bigg(\frac{x-\alpha}{\gamma}\bigg) - \texttt{relu}\bigg(\frac{x-(\beta-\gamma)}{\gamma}\bigg) + \texttt{relu}\bigg(\frac{x-\beta}{\gamma}\bigg)
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-neural_nets_bump_as_relu_net}

:::{.column-margin}
Here we show how a neural net can represent a function as a sum of basis functions. This idea is also foundational in signal processing, where signals are often represented as a sum of sine waves @sec-fourier_analysis, boxes @fig-upsampling_and_downsampling-nn_interp, or trapezoids @fig-bilinear_interp.
:::
 
As $\gamma \rightarrow 0$, this approximation
becomes exact. The input to each of the four relus in
@eq-neural_nets_bump_as_relu_net is an affine function of the input
$x$, hence these four values can be represented by a linear layer with
four outputs. Then we apply a relu layer to these four values, and
finally we apply a linear layer to compute the sum over these relus (a
weighted sum with weights \[1,-1,-1,1\]). Therefore
@eq-neural_nets_bump_as_relu_net can be implemented as a
`linear`-`relu`-`linear` network. In @fig-neural_nets-bump_as_relus, we
show an example of constructing a bump in this way:

![A bump can be represented as a weighted sum of shifted and scaled relu functions.](figures/neural_nets/bump_as_relus.png){#fig-neural_nets-bump_as_relus}


Putting everything together, we have a `linear`-`relu`-`linear` for each
bump, followed by a linear layer for summing up all the bumps. The two
linear layers in sequence can be collapsed to a single linear layer, and
hence the full function can therefore be approximated, to arbitrary
precision, by a `linear`-`relu`-`linear` net.

:::{.column-margin}
Most literature refers to such a net as having a single hidden layer, using the convention that we don't count pre- and postactivation neurons as separate layers.
:::

Notice that in this approximation, we need four relu neurons for each
bump we are modeling. Therefore if we want to approximate a very bumpy
function, say with $N$ bumps, we will need $4N$ relu neurons. In
general, to achieve arbitrarily good approximation to a curve we may
need an unbounded number of neurons in our network.

### Depth versus Width

Above we saw that if you have a hidden layer with $N$ neurons, you can
fit a scalar function with $\mathcal{O}(N)$ bumps. The number of neurons
on a single hidden layer is called its **width**.

:::{.column-margin}
If
different layers have different numbers of neurons, then we may specify
the width per layer. Here we will assume all layers have the same width
and simply speak of the width of the network.
:::

So, as we increase the width of a network, we can fit ever more complicated functions. What if we instead increase the **depth** of a network, that is, its number of layers? It turns out that this can also be an effective way to increase the capacity of the net, but its effect is a bit different than increasing width.

Interestingly, it is sometimes the case that *deep* nets require far
fewer parameters to fit data than *wide* nets. Evidence for this
statement comes mostly from empiricism, where researchers have found
that deeper nets just work better in practice on many popular problems.
However, there is also the beginning of a mathematical theory of when
and why this can happen. The basic idea of this theory is to establish
that there are certain classes of function that can be represented with
a polynomial number of neurons in a depth $d$ network but require an
exponential number of neurons in a depth $d^\prime$ network, for certain
$d^\prime < d$. Arguments along these lines are called **depth
separations**, and the interested reader can refer to
@telgarsky2016benefits to learn more about this ongoing line of
research.

## Deep Learning: Learning with Neural Nets

Using the formalism we defined in @sec-intro_to_learning, learning consists of using an *optimizer* to find a function in a *hypothesis space*, that maximizes an *objective*. From this perspective, neural nets are simply a special
kind of hypothesis space (and a particular parameterization of that
hypothesis space). **Deep learning** refers to learning algorithms that
use this parameterized hypothesis space.

Deep learning also typically involves using gradient-based optimization
to search the hypothesis space for the best fit to the data. We will
investigate this approach in detail in @sec-backpropagation, where we will learn about the **backpropagation** algorithm for gradient-based learning with neural nets. However, it is certainly possible to optimize neural nets with other methods, including zeroth-order optimizers like evolution
strategies @sec-gradient_descent-zeroth_order, @salimans2017evolution.

One intriguing alternative to backpropagation is called **Hebbian
learning** @hebb2005organization. Backpropagation is a *top-down*
learning algorithm, where errors incurred at the output (top) of the net
are propagated backward to inform earlier layers how to update their
weights and biases to minimize the loss, which is a form of learning
based on *feedback*. Hebbian learning, in contrast, is a *bottom-up*
approach, where neurons wire up just based on the *feedforward* pattern
of activity in the net. The canonical learning rule in Hebbian methods
is **Hebb's rule**: "fire together, wire together." That is, we increase
the weight of the connection between two neurons whenever the two
neurons are active at the same time. Although this learning rule is not
explicitly minimizing a loss function, it has been shown to lead to
effective neural representations. For example, Hebb-like rules can learn
**infomax** representations, which capture, in the neural activations,
as much information as possible about the input signal @linsker1988self.
Similar rules lead to networks that act like memory
banks @hopfield1982neural. Hebbian learning is also of interest because
it is considered to be more biologically plausible than backpropagation.
This is because Hebb's rule can be computed *locally*---each neuron
strengthens and weakens its weights based just on the activity of
adjacent neurons---whereas backpropagation requires global coordination
throughout the neural network. It is currently unknown how this global
coordination can be achieved in biological brains.

### Data Structures for Deep Learning: Tensors and Batches

The main data structure that we will encounter in deep learning is the **tensor**, which is just a multidimensional array. This may seem simple, but it's
important to get comfortable with the conventions of tensor processing.

In general, everything in deep learning is represented as tensors---the
input is one tensor, the activations are tensors, the weights are
tensors, the outputs are tensors. If you have data that is not natively
represented as a tensor, the first step, before feeding it to a deep
net, is to convert it into a tensor format. Most often we use tensor of
real numbers, that is, the elements of the tensor are in $\mathbb{R}$.

Suppose we have a dataset
$\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N$ of images $\mathbf{x}$
and labels $\mathbf{y}$. The tensor way of thinking about such a dataset
is as two tensors,
$\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C_0 \times H \times W }$ and
$\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times K}$. The first dimension of the
tensor is the number of elements in our dataset. The remaining
dimensions are the dimensionality of the images ($C_0$ color channels by
height $H$ by width $W$) and labels ($K$-way classification).

The activations in the network are also tensors. For the MLP networks we
have seen so far, the activation tensors have shape $N \times C_{\ell}$,
where $C_{\ell}$ is the number of neurons on layer $\ell$, sometimes
also called **channels** in analogy to the color channels of the input
image. In later chapters we will encounter other architectures where the
activation layers have additional dimensions, for example, in
convolutional networks we will see activation layers that are of shape
$N \times C_{\ell} \times H_{\ell} \times W_{\ell}$.

One other important concept is . Normally, we don't process one image at
a time through a neural net. Instead we run a *batch* of images all at
once, and they are processed in parallel. A batch sampled from the
training data can be denoted as
$\{\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{batch}}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}_{\texttt{batch}}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N_{\texttt{batch}}}$,
and the batch represented as a tensor has shape
$\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\texttt{batch}} \times C_0 \times H \times W}$
and $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\texttt{batch}} \times K}$.

The weights and biases of the net are also usually represented as
tensors. The weights and biases of a linear layer will be tensors of
shape $\mathbf{W}_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{C_{\ell+1} \times C_{\ell}}$
and $\mathbf{b}_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{C_{\ell+1}}$.

As an example, in
@fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network_tensors_and_batches below, we
visualize all the tensors associated with a batch of three datapoints
being processed by the MLP from @fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network.
For this network, the input is not a set of images but instead a set of
vectors $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\texttt{batch}} \times C_0}$. The
output is one value for each input vector, so we have
$\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\texttt{batch}} \times 1}$.

where the capital letters are the batches of datapoints and activations
corresponding to the lowercase names of datapoints and hidden units in
@fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network.

![The tensors that represent one pass through the MLP in @fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network](figures/neural_nets/simple_MLP_network_tensors_and_batches-2.png){#fig-neural_nets-simple_MLP_network_tensors_and_batches width=70%}

This example shows the basic concept of working with tensors and batches
for one-dimensional data, but, in vision, most of the time we will be
working with higher-dimensional tensors. For image data we typically use
four-dimensional tensors: batch $\times$ channels $\times$ height
$\times$ width; for videos we may use five-dimensional tensors: batch
$\times$ channels $\times$ height $\times$ width $\times$ time.
Three-dimensional (3D) scans have an additional *depth* spatial
dimension; videos of 3D data could therefore be represented by
six-dimensional tensors. As you can see, thinking in terms of
two-dimensional matrices is not quite sufficient. Instead, you should be
imagining data processing as operating on $N$-dimensional tensors,
sliced and diced in different ways. As a step in this direction, you may
find it useful to visualize tensors in 3D, as shown in
@fig-neural_nets-3D_tensor_example.


![A 3D tensor that could represent an $C \times H \times W$ color image.](figures/neural_nets/3D_tensor_example.png){#fig-neural_nets-3D_tensor_example width=20%}

This is closer to the actual ND tensors vision systems work with, and
many concepts can be adequately captured just by thinking in 3D. We will
see some examples in later chapters.

## Catalog of Layers

Below, we use the color blue to denote
[**parameters**]{.param_color_dark} and the color red to
denote [**data/activations**]{.data_color_dark} (inputs
and outputs to each layer). 

:::{.column-margin}
We color equations in
this way only in this chapter, to make clear the roles of different
variables. However, be on the lookout for these colors in figures later
in the book. We will often draw activations in red and parameters in
blue.

### Linear Layers

Linear layers are the workhorses of deep nets. Almost all parameters of
the network are contained in these layers; we call these parameters the
weights and biases. We have already introduced linear layers previously.
They look like this: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{out}}} = \textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\mathbf{W}} \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{in}}} + \textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\mathbf{b}} & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\texttt{linear}
\end{aligned}
$$


### Activation Layers


![Common pointwise nonlinearities.](figures/neural_nets/pointwise_nonlinearities.png){#fig-neural_nets-pointwise_nonlinearities}

If a net only contained linear layers then it could only compute linear
functions. This is because the composition of $N$ linear functions is a
linear function. **Activation layers** add nonlinearity. Activation
layers are typically pointwise functions, applying a scalar to scalar
mapping on each dimension of the input vector. Typically parameters of
these layers, if any, are not learned (but they can be). Some common
activation layers are defined below and are plotted in
@fig-neural_nets-pointwise_nonlinearities: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= 
        \begin{cases}
            1, &\text{if} \quad \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i] > 0\\
            0,              & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases} & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{threshold}\\
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i]}} & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{sigmoid}\\
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= 2*\texttt{sigmoid}(2*\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i])-1 & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{tanh}\\
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= \max(\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i],0) & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{relu}\\
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= 
        \begin{cases}
            \max(\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i],0), &\text{if} \quad \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i] \geq 0\\
            \textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{a}\min(\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i],0),              & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases} & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{leaky-relu}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Normalization Layers {#sec-neural_nets-normalization_layers}

Normalization layers add another kind of nonlinearity. Instead of being
a pointwise nonlinearity, like in activation layers, they are
nonlinearities that perturb each neuron based on the collective behavior
of a set of neurons. Let's start with the example of
(**batchnorm**) @ioffe2015batch.

Batchnorm **standardizes** each neural activation with respect to its
mean and variance over a batch of datapoints. Mathematically,
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] = 
    \textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\gamma}
    \frac{\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i] - \mathbb{E}[\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i]]}
         {\sqrt{\texttt{Var}[\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i]]}} 
    + \textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\beta} & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{batchnorm}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\gamma}$ and $\textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\beta}$ are learned parameters of this layer that maintain expressivity so that the layer can output values with non-zero mean and non-unit variance. Most commonly batchnorm is
applied using training batch statistics to compute the mean and
variance, which change batch to batch. At test time, aggregate
statistics from the training data are used. However, using test batch
statistics can be useful for achieving invariance to changes in the
statistics from training data to test data @wang2020fully.

:::{.column-margin}
Recall from statistics that the standard score of a draw of a random variable is how many standard deviations it differs from the mean: $z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$.
:::

There are numerous other normalization layers that have been defined
over the years. Two more that we will highlight are **$L_2$
normalization** and **layer normalization**
(**layernorm**) @ba2016layer. $L_2$ normalization projects the inputs
onto the unit hypersphere, which useful for bounding the activations to
unit vectors: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= 
    \frac{\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i]}{\left\lVert\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{in}}}\right\rVert_2} 
    & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{L2-norm}
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Layernorm is similar except that it standardizes the vector of input activations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i]\\
    \sigma^2 &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i] - \mu\right)^2\\
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= 
    \textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\gamma}
    \frac{\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i] - \mu}{\sigma} + 
    \textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\beta} 
    & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{layernorm}
\end{aligned}
$$

:::{.column-margin}
Notice that layernorm, like
$L_2$-normalization, maps the activation vector to the surface of a
hypersphere, but it also centers the activations to have zero mean, and
then scales and shifts the activations via $\gamma$ and $\beta$. As an
exercise, see if you can write layernorm using $L_2$-normalization as
one of the steps.
:::

Notice that layernorm also looks quite similar to batchnorm. Both standardize activations but do so with respect to different statistics. Layernorm computes a mean and variance over elements of a datapoint $\mathbf{x}_{\texttt{in}}$, and will do so separately for each such datapoint in a batch. Batchnorm computes the mean and variance per channel over datapoints in a batch. If we have a batch stored in the tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\texttt{batch}} \times C}$, then what layernorm does looks just like a "transpose" of what batchnorm does. Batchnorm standardizes each element of the tensor by the mean and
variance of its column. Layernorm standardizes each element by the mean
and variance of its row:


![Batchnorm vs layernorm. Gray indicates the region over which mean and variance are computed. See also Figure 2 of \cite{wu2018group} for more such visualizations.](figures/neural_nets/batchnorm_vs_layernorm_diagram.png){#fig-neural_nets-batchnorm_vs_layernorm_diagram width=70%}


One issue with batchnorm is that it requires processing a batch of
datapoints all at once, and introduces a dependency between each
datapoint in the batch. This violates the principle that datapoints
should be processed independently and identically (iid), and this can
lead to bugs if your method relies on the iid assumption. Layernorm does
not have this problem and does indeed process each datapoint in an iid
fashion.

### Output Layers

The last piece we need is an **output layer** that maps a neural
representation---a high-dimensional array of floating point numbers---to
a desired output representation. In classification problems, the desired
output is a class label, and the most common output operation is the
softmax function, which we have already encountered in previous
chapters. In image synthesis problems, the desired output is typically a
3D array with dimensions $N \times M \times 3$, and values in the range
$[0,255]$. A sigmoid multiplied by 255 is a typical output
transformation for this setting. The equations for these two layers are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= 
    \frac{e^{-\textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\tau}\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i]}}
         {\sum_{k=1}^K e^{-\textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\tau}\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[k]}} 
    & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \texttt{softmax}\\
    \textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{out}}}[i] &= 
    255*\texttt{sigmoid}(\textcolor[rgb]{1.0, 0.4, 0.38}{x_{\texttt{in}}}[i]) 
    & \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \text{common layer for image output problems}
\end{aligned}
$$ 

In the softmax definition, we have added a **temperature** parameter 
$\textcolor[rgb]{0.2, 0.6, 1.0}{\tau}$, which is used to scale how peaky, or confident, the predictions are.

The output layer is the input to the loss function, thus completing our
specification of the deep learning problem. However, to use the outputs
in practice requires translating them into actual pictures, or actions,
or decisions. For a classification problem, this might mean taking the
argmax of the softmax distribution, so that we can report a single
class. For image prediction problems, it might mean rounding each output
to an integral value since common image formats represent RGB values as
integers.

There are of course many other output transformations you can try.
Often, they will be very problem specific since they depend on the
structure of the output space you are targeting.

## Why Are Neural Networks a Good Architecture?

As you will soon learn, almost all modern computer vision algorithms
involve deep nets in one way or another. So you may be wondering: why
are deep nets such a good architecture? We will highlight here five
reasons:

1.  They are high capacity (big enough nets are universal
    approximators).

2.  They are differentiable (the parameters can be optimized via
    gradient descent).

3.  They have good inductive biases (neural architectures reflect real
    structure in the world).

4.  They run efficiently on parallel hardware.

5.  They build abstractions.

Let's look at reasons 1-3 in light of the discussion of searching for
truth from chapter @sec-problem_of_generalization (see
@fig-problem_of_generalization-search_space_tools). Reason 1 relates to
the size of the hypothesis space. The hypothesis space can be made very
big if we use a large neural network with many parameters. So we can
usually be sure that our true solution (or a close approximation to it)
does indeed lie in the space spanned by the neural net architecture.
Reason 2 says that searching for the solution within this space is
relatively easy, since we can use gradients to direct us toward ever
better fits to the data. Reason 3 is one we will only come to appreciate
later in the book as we investigate more advanced neural net
architectures. It turns out that these architectures impose constraints
and regularizers that bias our search toward solutions that capture true
structure about the visual world, and this leads to learned solutions
that generalize.

Reason 4 is equally important to the first three: it says we can do all
of this *efficiently* because most computations can be parallelized on
modern hardware; in particular both matrix multiplies (linear layers)
and pointwise operations (e.g., relu layers) are easy to parallelize on
graphical processing units. Further, most operations are applied to
image batches, where each item in the batch can be sent to a different
parallel compute node.

Reason 5 is the perhaps the most subtle. It is related to the layered
structure of neural nets. Layer by layer, neural nets build up
increasingly abstracted representations of the input data, and these
abstractions tend to be increasingly useful. This argument is not easy
to appreciate at first glance, but it will be a major theme of the
subsequent chapters in this book, especially those on representation
learning. For now, just keep in mind that the *internal representations*
that are built up layer by layer in deep nets are useful and important
beyond just the net's overall input-output behavior.

## Concluding Remarks

Neural nets are a very simple and useful parameterized hypothesis space.
They are universal approximators that can be trained via gradient
descent and run on parallel hardware. *Deep* nets are especially
effective in computer vision; as we will soon see, deep architectures
can be constructed that specifically reflect structure in the visual
world, making visual processing highly efficient and performant.
Artificial neural nets also have connections to the real neural nets in
our brains. This connection runs deeper than merely sharing a name: the
deep net architectures we will see later in this book (e.g.,
convolutional networks, transformers) are our best current models of
computation in animal brains, in the sense that they explain brain data
better than any competing models @Schrimpf2020integrative. This is a
class of models truly worth paying attention to.
