# Introduction to Learning {#sec-intro_to_learning}

## Introduction

The goal of learning is to extract lessons from past experience in order
to solve future problems. Typically, this involves searching for an
algorithm that solves past instances of the problem. This algorithm can
then be applied to future instances of the problem.


Because learning is itself an algorithm, it can be understood as a
meta-algorithm: an algorithm that outputs algorithms
(@fig-learning_as_meta_algorithm).

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/learning_as_meta_algorithm.png){#fig-learning_as_meta_algorithm}

Learning usually consists of two phases: the phase, where we search for
an algorithm that performs well on past instances of the problem
(training data), and the phase, where we deploy our learned algorithm to
solve new instances of the problem.

## Learning from Examples



Imagine you find an ancient mathematics text, with marvelous looking
proofs, but there is a symbol you do not recognize, "$\star$\". You see
it being used here and there in equations, and you note down examples of
its behavior: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    2 \star 3 &= 36\nonumber \\
    7 \star 1 &= 49\nonumber \\
    5 \star 2 &= 100\nonumber \\
    2 \star 2 &= 16\nonumber
\end{aligned}
$$ 

What do you think $\star$ represents? What function is
it computing? Do you have it? Let's test your answer: what is the value
of $3 \star 5$? (The answer is in the figure below.)

It may not seem like it, but you just performed learning! You *learned*
what $\star$ does by looking at examples. In fact,
@fig-star_symbol_learning shows what you did:

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/star_symbol_learning.png){#fig-star_symbol_learning}

Nice job!

It turns out, we can learn almost anything from examples. Remember that
we are learning an *algorithm*, i.e., a computable mapping from inputs
to outputs. A formal definition of *example*, in this context, is an
{`input`, `output`} pair. The examples you were given for $\star$
consisted of four such pairs: 

$$\begin{aligned}
    &\{\texttt{input:} [2,3], \texttt{output:} 36\}\nonumber \\
    &\{\texttt{input:} [7,1], \texttt{output:} 49\}\nonumber \\
    &\{\texttt{input:} [5,2], \texttt{output:} 100\}\nonumber \\
    &\{\texttt{input:} [2,2], \texttt{output:}16\}\nonumber
\end{aligned}$$ 

This kind of learning, where you observe example input-output behavior and infer a functional mapping that explains this behavior, is called **supervised learning**.

We were able to model the behavior of $\star$, on the examples we were
given, with a simple algebraic equation. Let's try something rather more
complicated. From the three examples in
@fig-intro_to_learning-inpainting_example, can you figure out what the
operator $F$ does?

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/inpainting_example.png){#fig-intro_to_learning-inpainting_example}

You probably came up with something like "it fills in the missing
pixels." That's exactly right, but it's sweeping a lot of details under
the rug. Remember, we want to learn an *algorithm*, a procedure that is
completely unambiguous. How exactly does $F$ fill in the missing pixels?

It's hard to say in words. We may need a very complex algorithm to
specify the answer, an algorithm so complex that we could never hope to
write it out by hand. This is the point of machine learning. The machine
writes the algorithm for us, but it can only do so if we give it many
examples, not just these three.

:::{.column-margin}
Some things are not learnable from examples, such as
noncomputable functions. An example of a noncomputable function is a
function that takes as input a program and outputs a 1 if the program
will eventually finish running, and a 0 if it will run forever. It is
noncomputable because there is no algorithm that can solve this task in
finite time. However, it might be possible to learn a good approximation
to it.
:::



## Learning without Examples

Even without examples, we can still learn. Instead of matching
input-output examples, we can try to come up with an algorithm that
optimizes for desirable *properties* of the input-output mapping. This
class of learners includes and .

In unsupervised learning, we are given examples of *input data*
$\{x^{(i)}\}^N_{i=1}$ but we are not told the target outputs
$\{y^{(i)}\}^N_{i=1}$. Instead the learner has to come up with a model
or representation of the input data that has useful properties, as
measured by some **objective function**. The objective could be, for
example, to compress the data into a lower dimensional format that still
preserves all information about the inputs. We will encounter this kind
of learning in part @generative_models_and_representation_learning of this
book, on representation learning and generative modeling.

In reinforcement learning, we suppose that we are given a that
explicitly measures the quality of the learned function's output. To be
precise, a reward function is a mapping from outputs to scores:
$r: \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The learner tries to come up
with a function that maximizes rewards. This book will not cover
reinforcement learning in detail, but this kind of learning is becoming
an important part of computer vision, especially in the context of
vision for robots. We direct the interested reader to
@sutton2018reinforcement to learn more. 

## Key Ingredients {#sec-intro_to_learning-key_ingredients}

A learning algorithm consists of three key ingredients:

1.  : What does it mean for the learner to succeed, or, at least, to
    perform well?

2.  : What is the set of possible mappings from inputs to outputs that
    we will we search over?

3.  : *How*, exactly, do we search the hypothesis space for a specific
    mapping that maximizes the objective?

These three ingredients, when applied to large amounts of data, and run
on sufficient hardware (referred to as **compute**) can do amazing
things. We will focus on the learning algorithms in this chapter, but
often the data and compute turn out to be more important.

A learner outputs an algorithm, $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$, which maps inputs, $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$, to outputs, $\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}$.
Commonly, $f$ is referred to as the **learned function**. The objective
that the learner optimizes is typically a function that scores model
outputs, $\mathcal{L}: \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, or compares
model outputs to target answers, $\mathcal{L}: \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. We will interchangeably call this $\mathcal{L}$ either the **objective function**, the **loss function**, or the **loss**. A loss almost always refers to an objective we seek to *minimize*, whereas an objective function can be used to describe objectives we seek to minimize as well as those we seek to maximize.

### Importance of Parameterization

The hypothesis space can be described by a set $\mathcal{F}$ of all the
possible functions under consideration by the learner. For example, one
hypothesis space might be "all mappings from
$\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$" and another could be "all
functions $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$
that satisfy the conditions of being a distance metric." Commonly,
however, we will not just specify the hypothesis space, but also how we
parameterize the space. For example, we may say that our *parameterized*
hypothesis space is $y = \theta_1 x + \theta_0$, where $\theta_0$ and
$\theta_1$ are the parameters. This example corresponds to the space of
affine functions from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, but this is
not the only way to parameterize that space. Another choice could be
$y = \theta_2\theta_1 x + \theta_0$, with parameters $\theta_0$,
$\theta_1$, and $\theta_2$. These two choices parameterize *exactly the
same space*, that is, any affine functions can be represented by either
parameterization and both parameterizations can only represent affine
functions. However, these two parameterizations are not equivalent,
because optimizers and objectives may treat different parameterizations
differently. Because of this, to fully define a learning algorithm, it
is important to specify how the hypothesis space is parameterized.

## Empirical Risk Minimization: A Formalization of Learning from Examples

The three ingredients from the last section can be formalized using the
framework of (**ERM**). This framework applies specifically to the
supervised setting where we are learning a function that predicts
$\mathbf{y}$ from $\mathbf{x}$ given many training examples
$\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)},\mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}^N_{i=1}$. The idea is to minimize
the average error (i.e., risk) we incur over all the training data
(i.e., empirical distribution). The ERM problem is stated as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}(f(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}),\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) \quad\triangleleft\quad \text{ERM}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the hypothesis space, $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function, and $\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N$ is the training data (example {`input`, `output`} pairs), and $f$ is the learned function.

## Learning as Probabilistic Inference

Depending on the loss function, there is often an interpretation of ERM as doing maximum likelihood probabilistic inference. In this interpretation, we are trying to infer the hypothesis $f$ that assigns the highest probability to the data. For a model that predicts $\mathbf{y}$ given $\mathbf{x}$, the max likelihood $f$ is:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,max}}_f p\big(\{\mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N \bigm | \{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N, f\big) \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{Max likelihood learning}
\end{aligned}
$$

The term
$p\big(\{\mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N \bigm | \{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N, f\big)$
is called the **likelihood** of the $\mathbf{y}$ values given the model
$f$ and the observed $\mathbf{x}$ values, and maximizing this quantity
is called **maximum likelihood learning**.

In later chapters we will see that **priors** $p(f)$ can also be used
for inferring the most probable hypothesis. When a prior is used in
conjunction with a likelihood function, we arrive at **maximum a
posteriori learning** (**MAP learning**), which infers the most probable
hypothesis given the training data: 

$$\begin{aligned}
    &\mathop{\mathrm{arg\,max}}_f p\big(f \bigm | \{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N\big) \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \text{MAP learning}\\
    & = \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,max}}_f p\big(\{\mathbf{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N \bigm | \{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N, f\big)p\big(f\big) \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \text{by Bayes' rule}
\end{aligned}$$

## Case Studies

The next three sections cover several case studies of particular learning problems. Examples 1 and 3 showcase the two most common workhorses of machine learning: regression and classification. Example 2, Python program induction, demonstrates that the paradigms in this chapter are not limited to simple systems but can actually apply to very
general and sophisticated models.

### Example 1: Linear Least-Squares Regression {#sec-intro_to_learning-least_squares}

One of the simplest learning problems is known as **linear least-squares
regression**. In this setting, we aim to model the relationship between
two variables, $x$ and $y$, with a line.

As a concrete example, let's imagine $x$ represents the temperature
outside, and $y$ represents the number people at the beach. As before,
we train (i.e., fit) our model on many observed examples of
{`temperature outside`, `number of people at the beach`} pairs, denoted
as $\{x^{(i)},y^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N$. At test time, this model can be
applied to predict the $y$ value of a new query $x'$, as shown in
@fig-intro_to_learning-ols_train_test.

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/ols_train_test.png){#fig-intro_to_learning-ols_train_test}

Our *hypothesis space* is linear functions, that is, the relationship
between $x$ and our predictions $\hat{y}$ of $y$ has the form
$\hat{y} = f_{\theta}(x) = \theta_1 x + \theta_0$. This hypothesis space
is parameterized by a two scalars, $\theta_0, \theta_1 \in \mathbb{R}$,
the intercept and slope of the line. In this book, we will use $\theta$
in general to refer to any parameters that are being learned. In this
case we have $\theta = [\theta_0, \theta_1]$. Learning consists of
finding the value of these parameters that maximizes the objective.

Our *objective* is that predictions should be near ground truth targets
in a least-squares sense, that is, $(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2$ should
be small for all training examples $\{x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N$. We
call this objective the $L_2$ loss: 

$$\begin{aligned}
    J(\theta) &= \sum_i \mathcal{L}(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\
    &\quad \mathcal{L}(\hat{y}, y) = (\hat{y} - y)^2 \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad L_2 \text{ loss}
\end{aligned}$$ 

The full learning problem is as follows: 

$$\begin{aligned}
    \theta^* = \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^N (\theta_1 x^{(i)} + \theta_0 - y^{(i)})^2.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can choose any number of optimizers to solve this problem. A first idea might be "try a bunch of random values for $\theta$ and return the one that maximizes the objective." In fact, this simple approach works, it just can be rather slow since we are searching
for good solutions blind. A better idea can be to exploit *structure* in the search problem. For the linear least-squares problem, the tools of calculus give us clean mathematical structure that makes solving the optimization problem easy, as we show next.

From calculus, we know that at any maxima or minima of a function, $J(\theta)$, with respect to a variable $\theta$, the derivative $\frac{\partial{J(\theta)}}{\partial{\theta}} = 0$. We are trying to find the minimum of the objective $J(\theta)$: 

$$\begin{aligned}
    J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N (\theta_1 x^{(i)} + \theta_0 - y^{(i)})^2.
\end{aligned}$$ 

This function can be rewritten as 
$$\begin{aligned}
    J(\theta) = (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\theta)^\mathsf{T}(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$ 
with 
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{X} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & x^{(1)}  \\
    1 & x^{(2)} \\
    \vdots & \vdots \\
    1 & x^{(N)}
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
\mathbf{y} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
    y^{(1)}  \\
    y^{(2)} \\
    \vdots \\
    y^{(N)}
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
\theta = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
    \theta_0 \\
    \theta_1
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{aligned}$$

The $J$ is a quadratic form, which has a single global minimum where the derivative is zero, and no other points where the derivative is zero. Therefore, we can solve for the $\theta^*$ that minimizes $J$ by finding the point where the derivative is zero. The derivative is:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta} =  2(\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X} \theta - \mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}).
\end{aligned}
$$ 

We set this derivative to zero and solve for $\theta^*$:
$$\begin{aligned}
    2(\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X} \theta^* - \mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}) &= 0\\
\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X} \theta^* &= \mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}\\
\theta^* &= (\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}.
\end{aligned}$$

The $\theta^*$ defines the best fitting line to our data, and this line
can be used to predict the $y$ value of future observations of $x$
(@fig-intro_to_learning-ols_fit).

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/ols_fit.png){#fig-intro_to_learning-ols_fit}

We can now summarize the entire linear least-squares learning problem as
follows:

:::{.column-margin}
In these diagrams, we will sometimes describe the objective just in terms of $\mathcal{L}$, in which case it should be understood that this implies $J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}(f_{\theta}(x^{(i)}), y^{(i)})$.
:::


### Example 2: Program Induction

At the other end of the spectrum we have what is known as **program
induction**, which is one of the broadest classes of learning algorithm.
In this setting, our hypothesis space may be all Python programs. Let's
contrast linear least-squares with Python program induction.
@fig-intro_to_learning-ols_system_diagram shows what linear
least-squares looks like.

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/ols_system_diagram.png){#fig-intro_to_learning-ols_system_diagram}

The learned function is an algebraic expression that maps $x$ to $y$.
Learning consisting of searching over two scalar parameters, $\theta_0$
and $\theta_1$.

@fig-intro_to_learning-program_induction_system_diagram shows Python
program induction solving the same problem. In this case, the learned
function is a Python program that maps $x$ to $y$. Learning consisted of
searching over the space of all possible Python programs (within some
max length). Clearly that's a much harder search problem than just
finding two scalars. In chapter @sec-problem_of_generalization, we will see some
pitfalls of using too powerful a hypothesis space when a simpler one
will do.

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/program_induction_system_diagram.png){#fig-intro_to_learning-program_induction_system_diagram}

### Example 3: Classification and Softmax Regression {#sec-intro_to_learning-image_classification}

A common problem in computer vision is to recognize objects. This is a
problem. Our input is an image $\mathbf{x}$, and our target output is a
class label $\mathbf{y}$ (@fig-intro_to_learning-image_classification).

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/image_classification.png){width="100%"}

How should we formulate this task as a learning problem? The first
question is how do we even represent the input and output? Representing
images is pretty straightforward; as we have seen elsewhere in this
book, they can be represented as arrays of numbers representing
red-green-blue colors:
$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$, where $H$ is image
height and $W$ is image width.

How can we represent class labels? It turns out a convenient
representation is to let $\mathbf{y}$ be a $K$-dimensional vector, for
$K$ possible classes, with $y_k = 1$ if $\mathbf{y}$ represents class
$k$, and $y_k = 0$ otherwise. This representation is called a **one-hot
code**, since just one element of the vector is on ("hot"). Each class
has a unique one-hot code. We will see why this representation makes
sense shortly. The one-hot codes are the targets for the function we are
learning. Our goal is to learn a function $f_{\theta}$ that output
vectors $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ that match the one-hot codes, thereby
correctly classifying the input images. 

Next, we need to pick a loss function. Our first idea might be that we
should minimize misclassifications. That would correspond to the so
called : $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L}(\hat{\mathbf{y}},\mathbf{y}) = \mathbb{1}(\hat{\mathbf{y}}\neq\mathbf{y}),
\end{aligned}$$ where $\mathbb{1}$ is the indicator function that
evaluates to 1 if and only if its argument is true, and 0 otherwise.
Unfortunately, minimizing this loss is a discrete optimization problem,
and it is NP-hard. Instead, people commonly use the , which is
continuous and differentiable (making it easier to optimize):
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L}(\hat{\mathbf{y}},\mathbf{y}) = H(\mathbf{y}, \hat{\mathbf{y}}) = - \sum_{k=1}^K y_k \log \hat{y}_k \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad \text{cross-entropy loss}
\end{aligned}$$ The way to think about this is $\hat{y}_k$ should
*represent the probability* we think the image is an image of class $k$.
Under that interpretation, minimizing cross-entropy maximizes the log
likelihood of the ground truth observation $\mathbf{y}$ under our
model's prediction $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$.

For that interpretation to be valid, we require that $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$
represent a (**pmf**). A pmf $\mathbf{p}$, over $K$ classes, is defined
as a $K$-dimensional vector with elements in the range $[0,1]$ that sums
to 1. In other words, $\mathbf{p}$ is a point on the
$(K-1)$-**simplex**, which we denote as
$\mathbf{p} \in \vartriangle^{K-1}$.

To ensure that the output of our learned function $f_{\theta}$ has this
property, i.e., $f_{\theta} \in \vartriangle^{K-1}$, we can compose two
steps: (1) first apply a function
$z_{\theta}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^K$, (2) then squash the
output into the range $[0,1]$ and normalize it to sum to 1. A popular
way to squash is via the function:

:::{.column-margin}
Using softmax is a
modeling choice; we could have used any function that squashes into a
valid pmf, that is, a nonnegative vector that sums to 1.
:::


$$\begin{aligned}
    &\mathbf{z} = z_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})\\
    &\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \texttt{softmax}(\mathbf{z})\\
    &\quad \quad \hat{y}_j = \frac{e^{-z_j}}{\sum_{i=1}^K e^{-z_k}}.
\end{aligned}$$ The values in $\mathbf{z}$ are called the **logits** and
can be interpreted as the unnormalized log probabilities of each class.
Now we have, $$\begin{aligned}
    \hat{\mathbf{y}} = f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) = \texttt{softmax}(z_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}))
\end{aligned}$$ @fig-softmax_regression_diagram shows what the
variables look like for processing one photo of a fish during training.

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/softmax_regression_diagram.png){width="100%"}

The prediction placed about 40 percent probability on the true class,
"guitarfish," so we are 60 percent off from an ideal prediction
(indicated by the red bar; an ideal prediction would place 100 percent
probability on the true class). Our loss is $-\log 0.4$.

This learning problem, which is also called , can be summarized as
follows:

:::{.column-margin}
Softmax regression is just one way to model a
classification problem. We could have made other choices for how to map
input data to class labels.
:::



::: center
:::

Notice that we have left the hypothesis space only partially specified,
and we left the optimizer unspecified. This is because softmax
regression refers to the whole family of learning methods that have this
general form. This is one of the reasons we conceptualized the learning
problem in terms of the three key ingredients described previously: you
can often develop them each in isolation, then mix and match.

## Learning to Learn

Learning to learn, also called , is a special case of learning where the
hypothesis space is learning algorithms.

Recall that learners train on past instances of a problem to produce an
algorithm that can solve future instances of the problem. The goal of
metalearning is to handle the case where the future problem we will
encounter is itself a learning problem, such as "find the least-squares
line fit to these data points." One way to train for this would be by
example. Suppose that we are given the following {`input`, `output`}
examples: $$\begin{aligned}
    &\{\texttt{input:} \big(x:[1,2], y:[1,2]\big), &&\texttt{output:} y = x\}\nonumber \\
    &\{\texttt{input:} \big(x:[1,2], y:[2,4]\big), &&\texttt{output:} y = 2x\}\nonumber \\
    &\{\texttt{input:} \big(x:[1,2], y:[0.5,1]\big), &&\texttt{output:} y = \frac{x}{2}\}\nonumber
\end{aligned}$$ These are examples of performing least-squares
regression; therefore the learner can fit these examples by learning to
perform least-squares regression.

:::{.column-margin}
Note that
least-squares regression is not the unique solution that fits these
examples, and the metalearner might arrive at a different solution that
fits equally well.
:::

 Since least-squares regression is itself
a learning algorithm, we can say that the learner learned to learn.

We started this chapter by saying the learning is a meta-algorithm: it's
an algorithm that outputs an algorithm. Metalearning is a
meta-meta-algorithm and we can visualize it by just adding another outer
loop on top of a learner, as shown in
@fig-intro_to_learning-meta_learning_diagram.

![](./figures/intro_to_learning/meta_learning_diagram.png){width="100%"}

Notice that you can apply this idea recursively, constructing
meta-meta-\...-metalearners. Humans perform at least three levels of
this process, if not more: we have *evolved* to be *taught* in school
how to *learn* quickly on our own. 

## Concluding Remarks

Learning is an extremely general and powerful approach to problem
solving. It turns data into algorithms. In this era of big data,
learning is very often the preferred approach. It is a a major component
of almost all modern computer vision systems.
