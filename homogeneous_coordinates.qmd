# Representing Images and Geometry {#sec-geometry_homogeneous}

## Introduction

Before we dive into the material of this chapter, let's start by
questioning the way in which we have been representing images up to now.
In most of the chapters, we have represented images as ordered arrays of
pixel values, each pixel described by its grayscale value (or three
arrays for color images). We will call this representation the **ordered
array**. $$\boldsymbol\ell=\left[
\begin{matrix}
\ell[1,1] & \dots & \\
\vdots & \ell[n,m] & \vdots \\
 & \dots  & \ell[N,M] \\
\end{matrix}
\right]$$ Each value is a sample on a regular spatial grid. In this
notation $s$ represents the pixel intensity at one location. This is the
representation we are most used to and the typical representation used
when taking a signal processing perspective. It makes it simpler to
describe operations such as convolution.

However, an image can be represented in different ways, making explicit
certain aspects of the information present on the input. What else could
we do to represent an image? Another very different, but equivalent,
representation is to encode an image as a collection of points,
indicating its color and location explicitly. In this case, an image is
represented as a **set of pixels**:
$$\left\{ [\ell_i,x_i,y_i] : i \right\}
$${#eq-set_of_pixels} where $\ell_i$ is the pixel intensity (or color)
recorded at location $(x_i,y_i)$. This representation makes the geometry
explicit. It might seem like a trivial representation but it makes some
operations easy (and others complex). For instance, we can apply
geometric transformations easily by directly working with the spatial
coordinates. Imagine you want to translate an image, described by
equation (@eq-set_of_pixels), to the right by one pixel, you can do that
easily by simply creating the new image defined by the set of translated
pixels: $\left\{ [\ell_i,x_i+1,y_i] : i \right\}$.:::{.column-margin}
Representing images as sets of points is very common
in geometry-based computer vision. We will use this representation
extensively in the following chapters.
:::



Although both previous representations might seem equivalent, the set
representation makes it easy to deal with other image geometries where
the points are not on a regular array.

That representation can also be extended by representing geometry in
different ways such as using homogeneous coordinates, or positional
encoding. We will discuss homogeneous coordinates in this chapter.

The previous two representations are not the only ways in which we can
represent images. Another option is to represent an image as a
continuous function whose input is a location $(x, y)$ and it output is
an intensity, or a color, $\ell$: $$\ell(x,y) = f_{\theta}(x,y)$$ Thisimage representation is commonly used when we want to make image priors
more explicit. The function $f_{\theta}$ is parameterized by the
coefficients $\theta$. This function becomes especially interesting when
the parameters $\theta$ are different than the original pixel values.
They will have to be estimated from the original image. But once
learned, the function $f$ should be able to take as input continuous
spatial variables.

These three representations induce different ways of thinking about
architectures to process the visual input. These representations are not
opposed and can be used simultaneously.

The ordered array of pixels is the format that computers take as input
when visualizing images. However, a set of pixels is the most common
format when thinking about three-dimensional (3D) geometry and image
formation. Therefore, it is always important to be familiar with how to
transform any representation into an ordered array.

We will start by introducing homogeneous coordinates, an important tool
that will simplify the formulation of perspective projection.

## Homogeneous and Heteregenous Coordinates

Homogeneous coordinates represent a vector of length $N$ by a vector of
length $N+1$. The transformation rule from heterogeneous to homogeneous
coordinates is simply to add an additional coordinate, 1, to the
heterogeneous coordinates as shown here: $$\begin{pmatrix}
    x \\
    y 
    \end{pmatrix}
    \rightarrow 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $${#eq-2dhomo} It is the same if the vector has three dimensions:
$$\begin{pmatrix}    x \\
    y \\
    z
    \end{pmatrix}
    \rightarrow 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    z \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $${#eq-3dhomo}

We will refer to conventional Cartesian coordinate descriptions of a
point in 2D, such as $(x,y)$, or 3D, such as $(x,y,z)$, as
**heterogeneous coordinates** and write with rounded brackets in this
chapter. We denote their corresponding **homogeneous coordinate**
representations by square bracketed vectors.



:::{.column-margin}
August Ferdinand Möbius, a German mathematician and
astronomer, introduced homogeneous coordinates in 1827. He also
cocreated the famous Möbius strip.
:::



The homogeneous coordinates have the additional rule that all (non-zero)
scalings of a homogeneous coordinate vector are equivalent. For example,
to represent a 2D point, we have (transforming from heterogeneous to
homogeneous coordinates), $$\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \equiv 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \lambda x \\
    \lambda y \\
    \lambda
    \end{bmatrix}$$ for any non-zero scalar, $\lambda$. To go from
homogeneous coordinates back to the heterogeneous representation of the
point, we divide all the entries of the homogeneous coordinate vector by
their last dimension:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    w
    \end{bmatrix}
    \rightarrow 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    x/w \\
    y/w 
    \end{pmatrix}$$

@fig-homogeneousAndHeteregeneous illustrates how homogeneous and
heterogeneous coordinates relate to each other geometrically. A point in
homogeneous coordinates is scale invariant (any point within the line
that passes through the origin translates into the same point in
heterogeneous coordinates). We can already see that this is closely
related to the operation performed by perspective projection.

![Transformation rule between heterogeneous and homogeneous coordinates in 2D. All the points along the dotted line correspond to the same point in heterogeneous coordinates. Note that the points $(x,y)$ and $(x,y,1)$ live in different spaces.](figures/imaging_geometry/homogeneousAndHeteregeneous_VS3.png){width="70%" #fig-homogeneousAndHeteregeneous}

It is important to mention that while you can add two points in
heterogeneous coordinates, you can not do the same in homogeneous
coordinates!

## 2D Image Transformations {#sec-2dtransforms}

One important operation in computer vision (and in computer graphics) is
geometric transformations of shapes. Some of the common transformations
we'll want to represent include translation, rotation, scaling, and
shearing (see @fig-2dtransformations_clock). These transformations can
be written as affine transformations of the coordinate system. The
mathematical description of these transformations becomes surprisingly
simple when using homogeneous coordinates, and they will become the
basis for more complex operations such as 3D perspective projection and
camera calibration as we will see in later sections.

![2D geometric transformations. 
%On the left we see the original image. The next four transformations correspond to translation, rotation, scaling and shear. Those four transformations can be easily described with matrices. 
The final transformation is an arbitrary warping with a more complex deformation field.](figures/imaging_geometry/2d_transformations.png){width="100%" #fig-2dtransformations_clock}

We'll explore the use of homogeneous coordinates for describing 2D
geometric transformations first, then see how they can easily represent
3D perspective projection.

### Translation

Consider a translation by a 2D vector, $(t_x, t_y)$ as shown in
@fig-translations. We'll denote the coordinates after the
transformation with a prime. In heterogeneous coordinates, we have
$$\begin{pmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' 
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    x \\
    y 
    \end{pmatrix}
    +
    \begin{pmatrix}
    t_x \\
    t_y 
    \end{pmatrix}$$ We can write this translation in homogeneous
coordinates by the product: $$\begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & t_x \\
    0 & 1 & t_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}$$ What is interesting is that we have transformed an
addition into a product by a matrix, $\mathbf{T}$, and a vector,
$\mathbf{p}$, in homogeneous coordinates. Rewriting the equation above
as: $$\mathbf{p}' = \mathbf{T} \mathbf{p},$$ with the homogeneous
matrix, $\mathbf{T}$, defined as $$\mathbf{T} =             
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & t_x \\
    0 & 1 & t_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}$$ For calculations in homogeneous coordinates, both
matrices and vectors are only defined up to an arbitrary (non-zero)
multiplicative scaling factor.

To cascade two translation operations $\mathbf{t}$ and $\mathbf{s}$, in
heterogeneous coordinates, we have
$$\mathbf{p}' = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{t}  + \mathbf{s}$$

![(left) Translation. (right) Composition of two consecutive translations.](figures/imaging_geometry/translations.png){width=".7" #fig-translations}

In homogeneous coordinates, we cascade the corresponding translation
matrices: $$\mathbf{p}' = \mathbf{S} \mathbf{T} \mathbf{p},$$ where the
homogeneous translation matrix, $\mathbf{S}$, corresponding to the
offset $\mathbf{s}$, is: $$\mathbf{S} =            
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & s_x \\
    0 & 1 & s_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}$$

You can check that: $$\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & t_x \\
    0 & 1 & t_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & s_x \\
    0 & 1 & s_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & t_x+s_x \\
    0 & 1 & t_y+s_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}$$

In summary, in homogeneous coordinates a translation becomes a product
with a matrix, and chaining translations can be done by multiplying the
matrices together. The benefits of using the homogeneous coordinates
will become more obvious later.

### Scaling

Scaling the $x$-axis by $s_x$ and the $y$-axis by $s_y$, shown in
@fig-scaling, yields the transformation matrix in homogeneous
coordinates, $$\mathbf{S} =             
    \begin{bmatrix}
    s_x & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & s_y & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}$$

The scaling matrix is a diagonal matrix.

![Non-uniform or anisotropic scaling. In this example the $y$-axis is compressed and the $x$-axis is expanded.](figures/imaging_geometry/scaling.png){width=".6" #fig-scaling}

Uniform scaling is obtained when $s_x=s_y$, otherwise the scaling is
nonuniform or anisotropic. After uniform scaling, all of the angles are
preserved. In all cases, parallel lines remain parallel. Areas are
scaled by the determinant of the scaling matrix.

### Rotation

For a rotation by an angle $\theta$, @fig-rotation, we simply have the
matrix in homogeneous coordinates: $$\mathbf{R} =             
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta) & 0 \\
    -\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}$$

![Rotation by an angle $\theta$ counterclockwise around the origin.](figures/imaging_geometry/rotation.png){width=".6" #fig-rotation}

As in the case of the translation, a rotation in homogeneous coordinates
is a product $$\mathbf{p}' = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{p},$$ Also, as we should
expect, chaining two rotations with angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$, is the
same than applying a rotation with an angle $\alpha+\beta$. You can
check that multiplying the two rotation matrices you get the right
transformation.

The determinant of a rotation matrix is 1 and the matrix is orthogonal,
that is the transpose is equal to the inverse:
$\mathbf{R}^\mathsf{T}= \mathbf{R}^{-1}$. The inverse is also a rotation
matrix. The distance between any point and the origin does not change
after a rotation.

In heterogeneous coordinates, the transformation can also be written in
the same way but using only the upper-left $2\times2$ matrix.
Representing rotations in homogeneous coordinates has no benefit with
respect to heterogeneous coordinates. But the advantage is that now both
rotation and translation are written in the same way! They are both
products of a matrix times a vector, so that they can be combined as we
will discuss in @sec-chaining_transformations.

If the angle of rotation is very small, then we can approximate the
rotation matrix by its Taylor development (for small $x$,
$\sin(x) \approx x$ and $\cos(x) \approx 1$):
$$\mathbf{R} \simeq            
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & \theta & 0 \\
    -\theta & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}$$

For small angles a rotation becomes a shear, which we will discuss next.
In general, for all angles, a rotation can be written as two shears and
a scaling.

Rotations in 3D become more complex as there are multiple possible
parametrizations.

### Shearing

Shearing involves scale factors in the off-diagonal matrix locations, as
shown in the matrix, $\mathbf{Q}$: $$\mathbf{Q} =             
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & q_x & 0 \\
    q_y & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}$$

@fig-shear shows examples with an horizontal shear ($qx=1, q_y=0$), a
vertical shear ($q_x=0, q_y=1$), and an arbitrary shear.

![Three examples of shear transformation.](figures/imaging_geometry/shear.png){width="100%" #fig-shear}

In the example of the horizontal shear, the points are displaced along
horizontal lines by displacement proportional to the $y$ coordinate,
$x'=x+q_y y$.

In a shear, lines are mapped to lines, parallel lines remain parallel,
(non-zero) angles between lines change.

### Chaining Transformations {#sec-chaining_transformations}

As we have seen, homogeneous coordinates allows using all the four
different transformations as matrix multiplications. We can now build
complex transformations by combining these four transformations:
$$\mathbf{p}' = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & q_x & 0 \\
    q_y & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    s_x & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & s_y & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta) & 0 \\
    -\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & t_x \\
    0 & 1 & t_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{p}$$

In heterogeneous coordinates the translation will have to be modeled as
an addition breaking the homogeneity of this equation. The
transformations described in this section are summarized in
@fig-2dtransformations.

![Summary of 2D geometric transformations and their formulation in homogeneous coordinates.](figures/imaging_geometry/2d_transforms.png){width="100%" #fig-2dtransformations}

As matrix operation are noncommutative, the order in which operations
are done is important (i.e., it is not the same to rotate with respect
to the origin and then translate, as it is to translate and then
rotate). All of the geometric transformations we have described are
relative to the origin. If you want to rotate an image around an
arbitrary central location, then you need to first translate to put that
location at the origin, then rotate and then translate back.

$$\mathbf{p}' = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & t_x \\
    0 & 1 & t_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta) & 0 \\
    -\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & -t_x \\
    0 & 1 & -t_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{p}$$

Chaining transformations in such a way is a very important tool in
computer graphics and we will also use it extensively as we dive deeper
into geometry.

When chaining rotations and translations only we will have a **euclidean
transformation** (lengths and angles between lines are preserved). A
**similarity transform** is the result of chaining a rotation,
translation and scaling (with uniform scaling, $s_x=s_y$). In this case
angles are preserved but not lengths. Chaining all transformations
results in an **affine transformation**. Each set of transformations
forms a group.

### Generic 2D Transformations

In general, chaining translations, scalings, rotations and shears will
result in a generic matrix with the form: $$\mathbf{p}' = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b & c \\
    d & e & f \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{p}$$ Any transformation with that form (6 degrees of
freedom) is an affine transformation. An affine transformation has the
property that parallel lines will remain parallel after the
transformation; however, lengths and non-zero angles might change.

As the last row of the transformation is $[0,0,1]$, one could be tempted
to drop it and go directly from homogeneous to heterogeneous, using the
top $2 \times 3$ matrix, but this will only work if the input vector has
a 1 in the third component.

What happens if we have 9 degrees of freedom?

$$\mathbf{p}' = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b & c \\
    d & e & f \\
    g & h & i
    \end{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{p}$$ In fact we only have 8 degrees of freedom as a global
scaling of the matrix does not change the homogeneous coordinates. The
set of transformations described by this full matrix becomes more
general than the transformations described in the previous sections. The
additional degrees of freedom include **elations** and **projective
transformations**.

### Geometric Transformations as Convolutions

In @sec-linear_image_filtering we showed how certain
geometric transformations can be written as convolutions (such as the
translation) while others cannot (such as rotations, scalings, shears,
etc.). However, things change when adding geometry explicitly to the
image representation!

Once geometry is added to the representation, all of the transformations
we discussed before can be implemented as one-dimensional (1D)
convolutions over the locations as shown in the diagram in
@fig-rotation_as_convolution.

![Geometric transformation as a convolution. The input and output signals are represented as pixel sets with explicit geometry. The convolution kernels are $w_x$ and $w_y$, corresponding to one dimensional convolutions as they only mix input features within the same input vector. The output intensity values are the same as the input.](figures/imaging_geometry/rotation_as_convolution.png){width=".6" #fig-rotation_as_convolution}

In the diagram (@fig-rotation_as_convolution), each input element is a
vector $(x_i,y_i,\ell_i)$ where $x_i$, $y_i$ are the pixel location, and
$\ell_i$ is the pixel intensity at that location. The convolution
kernels are: $w_x=[\cos ( \theta), \sin ( \theta)]$ and
$w_y=[-\sin ( \theta), \cos ( \theta)]$. The weights are the same for
all inputs. The output is also represented using position explicitly:
$(x'_i,y'_i,\ell'_i)$.

However, note that to perform a convolution on the output intensity will
require translating the position encoding back into an image on a
rectangular grid. For instance, after a rotation, the locations for the
intensity values will change and the pixels will not lie on a
rectangular grid anymore. The convolution kernels for the intensity
channel will have to be transformed too.

## Lines and Planes in Homogeneous Coordinates

One interesting application of homogeneous coordinates is to use it to
describe lines and planes and perform operations with them. In 2D, the
equation of a line is $ax+by+c=0$, which can be written in homogeneous
coordinates as $$ax+by+c=0 \rightarrow 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b & c 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 0$$

In homogeneous coordinates, the equation of a line is the dot product:
$$\boldsymbol{l} ^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{p} = 0$$ where
$\boldsymbol{l}^\mathsf{T}= \left [a, b, c\right ]$. Therefore, a point
$\mathbf{p}$, belongs to the line when $\boldsymbol{l}$ and $\mathbf{p}$
are perpendicular.

This representation of the line is in homogeneous coordinates because it
is scale invariant. This is, $\left [a, b, c\right ]$ is the same line
as $\left [a/c, b/c, 1\right ]$. Therefore, it is also useful to
describe the equation of the line with
$\boldsymbol{l}^\mathsf{T}= \left [n_x, n_y, -d\right ]$ where
$(n_x,n_y)$ is the normal to the line and $d$ is the distance to the
origin.

Using homogeneous coordinates makes obtaining geometric properties of
points and lines very easy. Given two points $\mathbf{p}_1$ and
$\mathbf{p}_2$ in homogeneous coordinates, the line that passes by both
points is the cross product (@fig-points_and_lines_homogeneous_imggeo):
$$\boldsymbol{l} = \mathbf{p}_1 \times \mathbf{p}_2$$ This is because if
the line passes by both points, it has to verify that
$\boldsymbol{l}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{p}_1=0$ and
$\boldsymbol{l}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{p}_2=0$. That is, the vector
$\mathbf{l}$ has to be perpendicular to both $\mathbf{p}_1$ and
$\mathbf{p}_2$. The cross product between $\mathbf{p}_1$ and
$\mathbf{p}_2$ gives a vector that is perpendicular to both.

Following a similar argument, you can show that given two lines
$\boldsymbol{l}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{l}_2$ the intersection point between
them is the cross product (@fig-points_and_lines_homogeneous_imggeo):
$$\mathbf{p} = \boldsymbol{l}_1 \times  \boldsymbol{l}_2$$ The
coordinates of $\mathbf{p}$ computed that way will be given in
homogeneous coordinates. So you need to divide by the third component in
order to get the actual point coordinates in heterogeneous coordinates.

![](figures/imaging_geometry/points_and_lines_homogeneous.png){width=".7"}

If three 2D points are colinear, then the determinant of the matrix
formed by concatenating the three vectors, in homogeneous coordinates,
as columns is equal to zero:
$\det( [\mathbf{p}_1~\mathbf{p}_2~\mathbf{p}_3 ])=0$. If three lines
intersect in the same point we have a similar relationship:
$\det( [\boldsymbol{l}_1~\boldsymbol{l}_2~\boldsymbol{l}_3 ])=0$.

It is also interesting to point out that a 3D vector can be interpreted
as a 2D line or as a 2D point in homogeneous coordinates.

We can also do something analogous to represent planes in 3D. The
equation of a 3D plane is $aX+bY+cZ+d=0$, which can be written in
homogeneous coordinates as:

$$\mathbf{\pi}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{P} = 0$$ where
$\mathbf{\pi} = [a,b,c,d]^\mathsf{T}$ are the plane parameters and
$\mathbf{P}=[X,Y,Z,1]^\mathsf{T}$ are the 3D point homogeneous
coordinates.

Representing 3D lines with homogeneous coordinates is not that easy and
the reader can consult other sources @Hartley2004 to learn more about
representing geometric objects in homogeneous coordinates.

## Image Warping {#sec-image_warping}

Now that we have seen how to describe simple geometric transformations
to pixel coordinates, we need to go back to the representation of the
image as samples on a regular grid. This will require applying image
interpolation.

The first algorithm that usually comes to mind when transforming an
image is to take every pixel in the original image represented as
$[\ell_i,x_i,y_i]$, apply the transformation, $\mathbf{M}$, to the
coordinates, and record the pixel color into the resulting coordinates
in the target image (@fig-warping_sketch). As coordinates might result
in non-integer values, we can simply round the result to the closest
pixel coordinate (i.e., nearest neighbor interpolation as we discussed
in @sec-interpolation). This algorithm is called **forward
mapping**. It is an intuitive way of warping an image but it is really
not a good idea. We will have all sorts of artifacts such as missing
values and aliasing as shown in @fig-warping_sketch and
@fig-warping_forward_backward.

![](figures/imaging_geometry/warping_sketch.png){width="100%"}

The best approach is to use what is called **backward mapping** which
consists of looping over all the pixels of the target image and applying
the inverse geometric transform, $\mathbf{M}^{-1}$; we then use
interpolation (as described in @sec-interpolation in chapter
@-downsampling_and_upsampling) to get the correct color
value (@fig-warping_sketch). This process guarantees that there will be
no missing values (unless the coordinates go outside the frame of the
input image) and there will be no aliasing if the interpolation is done
correctly. To avoid aliasing, blurring of the input image might be
necessary if the density of pixels in the target image is lower than in
the input image. Figures
@fig-warping_sketch and
@fig-warping_forward_backward compare forward and backward
mapping.

![](figures/imaging_geometry/warping_forward_backward.png){width="100%"}

To achieve high image quality warping it is important to chose a high
quality interpolation filter such as bilinear, bicubic, or Lanczos.
MIP-mapping @Lance1983 is another popular technique for high quality and
efficient interpolation. MIP-mapping relies on a multiscale image
pyramid to efficiently compute the best neighborhood structure needed to
perform the interpolation at each location, which can be very useful
when warping an image onto a curved surface.

Image warping can be applied to arbitrary geometric transformations and
not just the ones described in this section.

## Implicit Image Representations {#sec-implicit_image_representations}

An image is an array of values,
$\boldsymbol\ell\in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M \times 3}$, where each value
is indexed as $\ell[n,m]$ when $n,m$ take only on discrete values. We
can say that interpolation is a way of transforming the discrete image
into a continuous signal: $\ell(x,y)$.

An implicit image representation via a function $f_\theta$ trained to
reproduce the image pixels is a function such that,
$$\ell(x,y) = f_{\theta}(x,y)$$ where now $x,y$ can take on any real
value.

### Interpolation

In the case of nearest neighbors or bilinear interpolation, the
parameters of the interpolation function $\theta$ is the input image
itself. For example, using a functional form, nearest neighbors
interpolation can be written as:
$$\ell(x,y) = \ell\left[ \text{round}(x), \text{round}(y) \right]$$

What is really interesting about thinking about interpolation in this
way is that we can now extend the space of possible functions
$f_{\theta}(x,y)$ to include other functional forms. For instance, this
function could be implemented by a neural network that will take as
input the two image coordinate values $x$ and $y$ and will output the
intensity value at that location. The training set for the neural
network is the image itself, and it will consist of the input-output
pairs $[(x_i, y_i); \ell(x_i,y_i)]$ (i.e., location as input and
intensities/colors as output). During training the neural network will
memorize the image. The training will contain only values at discrete
positions but in test time we can use any continuous input values. For
this formulation to work, the neural network should be able to
generalize to non-integer coordinate values, that is, it should be able
to interpolate between samples.

### Image Warping with Implicit Representations

Once the neural network, $f_{\theta}(x,y)$, has learned to reproduce the
image, we can reconstruct the original image or apply transformations to
it. Image warping is then implemented by simply applying the inverse
geometric transformation to the discrete coordinates of the output grid
and use the functional representation of the image to get the
interpolated values:
$$\hat{\ell} (x,y) = f_{\theta} \left( \mathbf{M}^{-1}(x,y,1)^\mathsf{T}\right)$$
In this equation the input location is written in homogeneous
coordinates, so the function $f$ will first have to divide by the third
component to translate the input back to heterogeneous coordinates.

The example in @fig-siren_rotation_and_scaling shows an image encoded
by a sinusoidal representation network (SIREN) @sitzmann2019siren and
then reconstructed with a rotation of 45 degrees and a scaling by 0.5
along both dimensions.

From this result we can make a few observations. First, we can see that,
due to the transformation, there is aliasing in the sampled image
(aliasing is most visible in the leg of the tripod). One way of avoiding
aliasing would be by sampling the output on a finer grid and then
blurring and downsampling the result to the desired image size. The
second observation is that the way the boundary is extended is not like
any of the methods that we studied in chapter
@sec-linear_image_filtering; instead the image is padded
by some form of noise that smoothly extends the image without adding
strong image derivatives.

We can also study the reverse problem where we have two images (one is a
transformed version of the other) and the goal is to identify the
transformation $\mathbf{M}$. This problem is called **image alignment**.

The spatial transformer network @Jaderberg2015 is an example of using
parametric image transformations inside a neural network. Such
transformation can be helpful during learning to align the training
examples into a canonical pose.

## Concluding Remarks

Homogeneous coordinates are extensively used in computer vision and
computer graphics. They allow simplifying the computation of geometric
image transformations. Therefore, many libraries in vision and graphics
assume that the user is knowledgeable about the different coordinate
systems.

One of the most important uses is in the formulation of perspective
projection. We will devote the next chapter to describing the image
formation process and camera models using homogeneous coordinates.

Representing images as collections of pixels with an explicit
representation of geometry has a long history and is at the center of
many modern methods for 3D image representation.
