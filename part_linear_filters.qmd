# Linear Filters {#sec-linear_filters}

In this set of chapters, we will discuss a wide family of linear filters. These filters lay the foundation for most representations for images and sequences. Even learning-based representations end up learning filters that are similar to those we will discuss here.

This part is composed of the following chapters:

## Outline

- **Chapter @sec-blur_filters** introduces low-pass filters. These are filters used to lower the resolution of an image and are a key building block of many image processing operations such as image upsampling and downsampling.

- **Chapter @sec-image_derivatives** describes a set of band-pass filters, such as image derivatives, and several applications.

- **Chapter @sec-temporal_filters** extends filtering to the temporal domain, and describes applications of spatiotemporal filters for motion estimation, a topic that will be further extended in [Part Understanding Motion](/part_understanding_motion.html).

## Notation

We will continue using the same notation as in the previous chapters.

- Images and sequences: We will use the $\ell$ symbol to denote images and sequences: $\ell \left[ n, m, t \right]$ or $\ell \left( x, y, t \right)$.

- Convolution kernels: We will use $h$, $g$.

- Derivatives: We will use subindices for partial derivatives, for example $\ell_x = \partial \ell / \partial x$.
