## A Few Notes About Object Recognition in Humans

Object perception is very rich and diverse area of interdisciplinary
research. Many of the approached in computer vision are rooted on
hypothesis formulated in trying to model the mechanism used by the human
visual system. It is useful to be familiar with the literature in
cognitive science and neuroscience to understand the origin of existing
approaches and to gain insights on how to build new models. Here we will
review only a few findings, and we leave the reader with the task of
going deeper into the field.
