# Single View Metrology {#chapter-3D_single_view}

## Introduction

The goal of this chapter is to introduce a set of techniques that allows
recovering three-dimensional (3D) information about the scene from a
single image like the picture of the office we used before
(@fig-finding_depth_office).

![](figures/single_view_3d/inverse_office_measurements.jpg){width=".8"}

Single view metrology relies on understanding the geometry of the image
formation process, the rules of perspective, and other visual cues
present in the image to answer questions about the 3D structure of the
scene. This is in contrast to other methods, like stereo vision,
structure from motion or multiview geometry, which utilize multiple
images to reconstruct 3D information. The reader should consult
specialized monographs for a deeper analysis such as the book on
multiview geometry by Hartley and Zisserman @Hartley2004.

There are many scenarios where recovering 3D information from a single
view is important. There are applications from which only one view is
available, such as when looking at paintings or TV, when analyzing
photographs, and so on. Even when we have stereo vision, stereo is only
effective when the disparity is large enough which limits the range of
distances for which stereo can be used reliably.

We could just start by diving into learning-based methods and train a
huge neural network to solve the task, but that would be no fun (we will
do it later, no worries). Instead, we will start by using a model based
single-view metrology. There will be no learning involved. Instead we
will derive cues for 3D estimation from first principles.

## A Few Notes about Perception of Depth by Humans

The image in @fig-streetgeons, recreated from Mezzanotte and Biederman
@Biederman1976, displays a flat set of lines that elicit a powerful 3D
perception. Even more striking is that we perceive far more than mere 3D
geometric figures (which is already intriguing, considering we are
looking at a flat piece of paper). We discern buildings, people, a car
in the street, the sky between the structures, and even what appears to
be the entrance to a movie theater on the left sidewalk. Yet, the
sidewalk is simply one line!

![](figures/single_view_3d/streetgeons-1.png){width=".8"}

We perceive everything we see in the sketch as 3D, even when we know
that it's merely a 2D image. Our 3D processing is ingrained that we
cannot easily switch off. That said, we are aware that it is just a
collection of lines and geometric figures drawn on a flat piece of
paper, but the 3D interpretation transforms the way in which we perceive
the sketch. The influence of the 3D perceptual mechanisms is better
appreciated when looking at visual illusions.

3D visual illusions are remarkably powerful. One captivating 3D illusion
is the **Ames room**.



:::{.column-margin}
The Ames room was invented by Adelbert Ames, director
of research at the Dartmouth Eye Institute, in 1946. Since then,
illusions based on Ames' ideas have been utilized by comedians to create
amusing effects.
:::



The Ames room is an irregular room constructed in such a way that when
you look at it with one eye from a particular vantage point, the room
appears to be perfectly rectangular. This is achieved by making the part
of the wall that is farther away from the viewer larger so that it
appears fronto-parallel.



The best way to understand this illusion is by building it and
experiencing it by yourself. You can find the instructions in
@fig-ames_room. When you look thought the aperture on the wall
indicated by "cut" the room will appear square and smaller than it
actually is, and it will seem as if you are looking inside the room from
the middle of it despite that the opening is closer to the right wall.

![](figures/single_view_3d/ames_room-1.png){width=".8"}

This illusion is especially remarkable when the room is large enough for
people to walk in. You will notice that as people walk along the back
wall, they appear to change in height. Your perception will disregard
all of your (very strong) prior expectations about how that person
should appear. @fig-ames_room_cat illustrates this phenomenon with our
cut-out version of the Ames room.

Clearly, a single image contains very strong cues about the 3D scene
structure. In the following sections we will study linear perspective,
arguably the most powerful among all pictorial cues used for 3D
interpretation from a 2D image.

## Linear Perspective

Linear perspective uses parallel and orthogonal lines, vanishing points,
the ground plane and the horizon line to infer the 3D scene structure
from a 2D image. 

:::{.column-margin}
The discovery of linear perspective
is attributed to the Italian architect Fillipo Brunelleschi in 1415.
:::



As we will see in the following sections, linear perspective relies on a
few assumptions about the scene and, as a consequence, linear
perspective is not a general cue that is useful in all scenes, but it is
very powerful in most human-made environments.

### Projection of 3D Lines

In perspective projection, 3D lines project into 2D lines in the camera
plane. Let's start writing the parametric vector form of a 3D line using
heterogeneous coordinates. We can parameterize a 3D line with a point,
$\mathbf{P}_0=[X_0, Y_0, Z_0]^\mathsf{T}$, and a direction vector,
$\mathbf{D} = [D_X, D_Y, D_Z]^\mathsf{T}$, as:

$$\mathbf{P}_t = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_0 + t D_x\\
    Y_0 + t D_y\\
    Z_0 + t D_z
    \end{bmatrix}
$${#eq-parametric_vector_line} The 3D point $\mathbf{P}_t$ moves along a
line when the independent variable $t$ goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
A camera located in the world coordinates origin will observe a 2D line
resulting from projecting the 3D line into the camera plane as shown in
the sketch shown in @fig-vanishing_points.![](figures/single_view_3d/vanishing_points-1.png){width="100%"}

We can get the equation of the 2D line that appears in the image by
using the perspective projection equations, resulting in:
$$\mathbf{p}_t = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_t\\
    y_t
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    f \dfrac{ X_0 + t D_X}{Z_0 + t D_Z}\\[12pt]
    f \dfrac{ Y_0 + t D_Y}{Z_0 + t D_Z}
    \end{bmatrix}
$${#eq-line_projection}

### Vanishing Points

Even though a line in 3D space extends infinitely, its 2D projection
doesn't. According to equation (@eq-line_projection), in the limit when
$t$ goes to infinity, the line converges to a finite point called the
vanishing point: $$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{v} = \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbf{p}_t =
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
    f \dfrac{D_X}{D_Z}\\[12pt]
    f \dfrac{D_Y}{D_Z}
    \end{array}
    \right ]\end{aligned}$${#eq-vanishingpoint} The vanishing point,
$\mathbf{v} = [v_x, v_y]^\mathsf{T}$, only depends on the direction
vector, $\mathbf{D}$, thus all parallel lines in 3D project into
non-parallel 2D images that converge to the same vanishing point in the
image. If $D_Z = 0$ then the 3D line is parallel to the camera plane and
the vanishing point is in infinite.

@fig-vanishing_lines_and_planes shows a set of parallel 3D lines and
their 2D image projections. Each group of parallel lines converges to a
different vanishing point. Lines that are parallel to the camera plane
remain parallel as they converge to a vanishing point in infinity.

![](figures/single_view_3d/vanishing_lines_and_planes-1.png){width="100%"}

All the sets of parallel lines inside a plane converge to a set of
co-linear vanishing points. These points lie along the plane's horizon
line.

Vanishing points are very useful to recover the missing depth of the
scene as we will see later. The human visual system also makes use of
vanishing points for 3D perception. Take, for example, the *leaning
tower visual illusion* @Kingdom2017 as depicted in @fig-LeaningTower1.
Here, a pair of identical images of the Leaning Tower of Pisa are placed
side by side. Interestingly, despite being identical, they create an
illusion of leaning with different angles. The image on the right
appears to have a greater tilt than the one on the left. One explanation
of this illusion is that the lines of each tower converge at a different
vanishing point. If both towers were parallel in 3D, all the lines would
converge to the same 2D vanishing point. As they do not, our brain
interprets that the towers should have different 3D orientations. This
process is automatic and we can not shut it down despite the fact that
we know both images are identical.

![](figures/single_view_3d/LeaningTower1.jpg){width="100%"}

Homogeneous coordinates offer an alternative way of working with
vanishing points. Let's start by writing the parametric vector form of a
3D line using homogeneous coordinates: $$\mathbf{P}_t = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_0 + t D_X\\
    Y_0 + t D_Y\\
    Z_0 + t D_Z\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_0/t + D_X\\
    Y_0 /t+ D_Y\\
    Z_0/t + D_Z\\
    1/t
    \end{bmatrix}
$${#eq-parametric_vector_line_homogeneous} The first term is equivalent to
the writing of the line in equation (@eq-parametric_vector_line). As
homogeneous coordinates are invariant to a global scaling, we can divide
the vector by $t$ which results in the second equality.In the limit $t \to \infty$ the fourth coordinate of equation
(@eq-parametric_vector_line_homogeneous) converges resulting in:
$$\mathbf{P}_\infty = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    D_X\\
    D_Y\\
    D_Z\\
    0
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{D}\\
    0
    \end{bmatrix}$$ Note that here we are representing a point at
infinity with finite homogeneous coordinates. This is another of the
advantages of homogeneous coordinates. 

:::{.column-margin}
Homogeneous
coordinates allow us to represent points at infinity with finite
coordinates by setting the last element to 0.
:::



The vanishing point, in homogeneous coordinates, is the result of
projecting $\mathbf{P}_\infty$ using the camera model, $\mathbf{M}$:
$$\mathbf{v} = 
    \mathbf{M} 
    \mathbf{P}_\infty 
    = 
    \mathbf{K} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{T} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{D}\\
    0
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \mathbf{K} \mathbf{R} \mathbf{D}
$${#eq-vanishing_projection} The last equality is obtained by using
equation (@eq-extrinsic), and it shows that the vanishing point
coordinates do not depend on camera translation. Only a camera rotation
will change the location of the vanishing points in an image. If a scene
is captured by two identical cameras translated from each other, their
corresponding images will have the same vanishing points.

Both equation (@eq-vanishingpoint) and equation
(@eq-vanishing_projection) are equivalent if we replace $\mathbf{K}$ by
the appropriate perspective camera model.

If instead of perspective projection, we have parallel projection, then
all the vanishing points will project at infinity in the image plane.

### Horizon Line

Any 3D plane becomes a half-plane in the image and has an horizon line.
The horizon line is the line that passes by all the vanishing points of
all the lines contained in the plane as shown in @fig-palma_horizon.

![](figures/single_view_3d/palma_horizon.png){width="100%"}

As parallel lines converge to the same vanishing point, parallel planes
also have the same horizon line. In @fig-palma_horizon, the lines in
the building facade that are parallel to the ground also converge to a
vanishing point that lies on the horizon line. In this particular
examples, the lines in the facade also happen to be parallel to one of
the axis of the floor tiles, converging to the same vanishing point on
the right side of the figure.

The ground plane is a special plane because it supports most objects.
This is different than a wall. Both are planes, but the ground has an
ecological importance that a wall does not have. The point of contact
between objects and the ground plane informs about its distance. The
distance between the contact point and the horizon line is related to
distance between the object and the camera. Objects further away have a
contact point projecting onto a higher point in the image plane.

@fig-horizon_line_cross_products illustrates how to detect the horizon
line using homogeneous coordinates. If lines $\boldsymbol{l}_1$ and
$\boldsymbol{l}_2$, in homogeneous coordinates, correspond to the 2D
projection of 3D parallel lines, we can obtain the vanishing point as
their intersection (cross-product,
$\boldsymbol{l}_1 \times \boldsymbol{l}_2$). If we now have another set
of parallel lines, contained in the same plane, $\boldsymbol{l}_3$ and
$\boldsymbol{l}_4$, we can get another vanishing point by computing
their cross-product. Finally, the horizon line is the line that passes
through both points that can be computed as the cross-product of the
vanishing points in homogeneous coordinates.

![](figures/imaging_geometry/horizon_line-1.png){width=".9"}

### Detecting Vanishing Points

@fig-vanishing_lines shows the office scene and three vanishing points
computed manually. In this scene there are three dominant orientations
along orthogonal directions. The three vanishing points are estimated by
selecting pairs of long edges in the image corresponding to parallel 3D
lines in the scene and finding their intersection.

![](figures/single_view_3d/office_vanishing_points_3-1.png){width="100%"}

Vanishing points can be extracted automatically from images by first
detecting image edges and their orientations (like we did in chapter
[\[chapter-simplesystem\]](#chapter:simplesystem){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-simplesystem"}) and then using RANSAC (section
[\[sec-RANSAC\]](#sec:RANSAC){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-RANSAC"}) to group the edges: every pair of edges will
vote for a vanishing point and the point with the largest support will
be considered a vanishing point.

There are also learning-based approaches for vanishing point detection
using graphical models @coughlan1999manhattan, or deep learning based
approaches such as DeepVP @Chang2018DeepVPDL and NeurVPS
@zhou2019neurvps.

## Measuring Heights Using Parallel Lines

Let's now use what we have seen up to now to measurement distances in
the world from a single image. We will discuss in this section how to
make those measurements using three vanishing points, or just the
horizon line and one vanishing point. We will not use camera calibration
or the projection matrix. For a deeper analysis we refer the reader to
the wonderful thesis of A. Criminisi @criminisi1999accurate.

Before we can make any 3D measurements we need to study an important
invariant of perspective projection: the cross-ratio.

### Cross-Ratio

As we have discussed before, perspective projection transforms many
aspects of the 3D world when projecting into the 2D image: angles
between lines are not preserved, the relative lengths between lines is
not preserved, parallel 3D lines do not project into 2D parallel lines
in the image (unless they are also parallel to the camera plane), and so
on. Fortunately, some geometric properties are preserved under
perspective projection. For instance, straight lines remain straight.
Are there other quantities that are preserved? The cross-ratio is one of
those quantities.

The cross-ratio of four collinear points is defined by the expression:
$$CR \left( \mathbf{P}_1,\mathbf{P}_2,\mathbf{P}_3,\mathbf{P}_4 \right) 
= 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{P}_3 -\mathbf{P}_1 \right| \left|\mathbf{P}_4 -\mathbf{P}_2 \right|}
{\left| \mathbf{P}_3 -\mathbf{P}_2 \right| \left|\mathbf{P}_4 -\mathbf{P}_1 \right|}$$
where $\left| \mathbf{P}_i -\mathbf{P}_j \right|$ is the euclidean
distance between points $\mathbf{P}_i$ and $\mathbf{P}_j$, using
heterogeneous coordinates.
![](figures/single_view_3d/4_colinear_points-1.png){width=".25"}The cross-ratio is considered the most important projective invariant.
Two sets of points $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ related by a projective
transformation, as shown in @fig-cross_ratio_description, have the same
cross-ratio (regardless of the choice of origin $\mathbf{O}$ or scale
factor). That is:
$$CR(\mathbf{P}_1,\mathbf{P}_2,\mathbf{P}_3,\mathbf{P}_4) = CR(\mathbf{Q}_1,\mathbf{Q}_2,\mathbf{Q}_3,\mathbf{Q}_4)$$

![](figures/single_view_3d/cross_ratio_description2-1.png){width=".9"}

The order in which these points are considered matters in the
calculation. There are $4!=24$ possible orderings resulting in six
different values. If two sets of points, related by a projection, have
the same ordering, then their cross ratio will be preserved. We do not
provide the proof for the cross-ratio invariant here.

When one of the points is at infinity, all the terms that contain that
point are cancelled out (this can also be seen by taking a limit). In
the case of the points $\mathbf{R}$ from @fig-cross_ratio_description
we get that cross-ratio is:
$$CR(\mathbf{R}_1,\mathbf{R}_2,\mathbf{R}_3,\mathbf{R}_4) = 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{R}_4 -\mathbf{R}_2 \right| }
{ \left| \mathbf{R}_3 -\mathbf{R}_2 \right|}$$ This value is equal to
the cross-ratio of the points $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$.

To gain some intuition about the cross-ratio invariant, let's look at an
empirical demonstration. @fig-cross_ratio_rulers shows a ruler seen
under different view points. The blue dots correspond to same ruler
locations with $P_1=0$ in, $P_2=6$ in, $P_3=8$ in, and $P_4=10$ in (we
are making these measurements in inches, but note that the units do not
affect the cross-ratio as it is scale invariant). Using those
measurements, the cross-ratio is: $(8 \times 4)/(2 \times 10) = 1.6$.
The same cross-ratio is obtained if we measure the positions of the four
points using image coordinates and measuring distances in the image
plane.

![](figures/single_view_3d/cross-ratio.png){width="100%"}

### Measuring the Height of an Object

The problem we will address in this section is how to measure the height
of one object given the height of a reference object in the scene. As
shown in @fig-office_measuring_desk_setup, the height of the bookshelf
is $h_{\text{bookshelf}}=197$ cm (in this example we will make our
measurements using centimeters, but again, the choice of units is not
important as long as all the measurements are consistent). Can we use
this information together with the geometry of the scene to estimate the
height of the desk, $h_{\text{desk}}$?

![](figures/single_view_3d/office_measuring_desk_setup-1.png){width="80%"}

Due to perspective projection, we can not directly compare the relative
height of the desk with respect to the height of the bookshelf using
distances measured over the image. In order to be able to compare 3D
distances using 2D image distances both objects need to be put in
correspondence first. The bookshelf height is the distance between the
3D points that correspond to the 2D locations of the bottom of the
bookshelf, $\mathbf{g}_b$, and the top of the bookshelf, $\mathbf{t}_b$.
Similarly, the desk height is the distance between the 3D points that
correspond to $\mathbf{g}_d$ and $\mathbf{t}_d$. We can not use directly
the points $\mathbf{g}_b$ and $\mathbf{t}_b$, and $\mathbf{g}_d$ and
$\mathbf{t}_d$ as they are given in image coordinates. In order to be
able to use distances in the image domain we need to first translate the
points defining the desk height on top of the bookshelf, and then use
the cross-ratio invariant to relate the ratio between image distances
with the ratios of 3D heights.

In the rest, all the vectors refer to image coordinates in homogeneous
coordinates. Let's start by projecting the desk height onto the
bookshelf. To do this we need to follow several steps:

-   Estimate the line that passes by the ground points $\mathbf{g}_d$
    and $\mathbf{g}_b$. Using homogeneous coordinates, the line can be
    computed using the cross-product:
    $$\boldsymbol{l}_1 = \mathbf{g}_d \times \mathbf{g}_b$$

-   Compute the intersection of the line $\boldsymbol{l}_1$ with the
    horizon line $\mathbf{h}$ as:
    $$\mathbf{a} = \boldsymbol{l}_1 \times \mathbf{h}$$ As the line
    $\boldsymbol{l}_1$ is on the ground plane, the point $\mathbf{a}$ is
    the vanishing point of line $\boldsymbol{l}_1$.

-   Compute the line that passes by $\mathbf{a}$ and the top of the desk
    $\mathbf{t}_d$ as:
    $$\boldsymbol{l}_2 = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{t}_d$$ Lines
    $\boldsymbol{l}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{l}_2$ are parallel on 3D and
    vertically aligned.

-   Finally we can compute where line $\boldsymbol{l}_2$ intersects with
    the bookshelf in the image plane which in this case will also
    correspond to an intersection of the corresponding 3D lines. We
    first compute the line that connects the bottom and top points of
    the bookshelf $\boldsymbol{l}_3 = \mathbf{g}_b \times \mathbf{t}_b$,
    and now we obtain the intersection with $\boldsymbol{l}_2$ as:
    $$\mathbf{b} = \boldsymbol{l}_2 \times \boldsymbol{l}_3$$

We can write all the previous steps into a single equation:
$$\mathbf{b} = (((\mathbf{g}_d \times \mathbf{g}_b) \times \mathbf{h}) \times \mathbf{t}_d) \times (\mathbf{g}_b \times \mathbf{t}_b)$$
Point $\mathbf{b}$ is the location where the top of the desk will be if
we physically rearrange the furniture to bring the desk and the
bookshelf into contact. The segment between points $\mathbf{b}$ and
$\mathbf{g}_b$ is the projection of the desk height on the bookshelf.
However, due to the foreshortening effect induced by perspective
projection, we cannot simply rely on the ratio of image distances to
estimate the desk's true height. Instead, we will utilize the
cross-ratio invariant to make this estimation.



:::{.column-margin}
As J. J. Gibson pointed out, the ground plane is very
useful for all kinds of 3D scene measurements.
:::

 In order to
use the cross-ratio invariant we need two sets of four colinear points
related by a projective geometry. @fig-office_measuring_desk_sketch
shows a sketch of the setup we have in @fig-office_measuring_desk.

![](figures/single_view_3d/office_measuring_desk-1.png){width="85%"}

In the image plane, we have the four image points $\mathbf{t}_b$,
$\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{g}_b$ and $\mathbf{v}_3$. Those four 2D image
points correspond to the 3D locations given by the top of the bookshelf,
desk height, ground and infinity (which is the location of the vertical
vanishing point in 3D).

![](figures/single_view_3d/office_measuring_desk_sketch-1.png){width="70%"}

The rest of calculations requires computing distances between points,
which only works when using heterogeneous coordinates (or homogeneous
coordinates if the last component is equal to 1 for all points). The
cross-ratio invariant between both sets of four points gives as the
equality:

$$CR(\mathbf{P}_1,\mathbf{P}_2,\mathbf{P}_3,\mathbf{P}_4) = CR(\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p}_2,\mathbf{p}_3,\mathbf{p}_4)
$${#eq-cross_ratio_shelf_desk}

The left side of the equality corresponds to the distances between the
3D points and the right side to the distances of the image points
measured in pixel units. As $\mathbf{P}_1$ is in infinity (as it
corresponds to the vanishing point), the left side ratio only has two
terms, resulting in the ratio between the bookshelf and desk heights. To
compute the hand side we need the coordinates of the corresponding four
image points. Those are provided in @fig-office_measuring_desk.
Replacing all those values in equation (@eq-cross_ratio_shelf_desk) we
obtain: $$\frac{h_{\text{bookshelf}}}{h_{\text{desk}}} = 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{v}_3 \right| \left| \mathbf{t}_b - \mathbf{g}_b \right| }{\left| \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{g}_b \right| \left| \mathbf{t}_b - \mathbf{v}_3  \right|}$$
The only unknown value in this equality is the height of the desk,
$h_{\text{desk}}$, which results in $h_{\text{desk}} \simeq 73.1$ cm,
which is close to the actual height of the desk (which is around 76 cm).### Height Propagation to Supported Objects

The method described in the previous section relies on using vertical
lines in contact with the ground plane to propagate information from one
point in space to another in order to make measurements. The method can
not work if we can not establish the vertical projection of a point into
the ground plane (or any other plane of reference). But once we have
estimated the height of objects that are in contact with the ground, we
can use them to propagate 3D information to other objects not directly
on top of the ground. We can estimate the height of objects that are not
in contact with the ground if they are on top of objects of known
height. As an example, let's estimate the red bottle's height, which we
can do after we estimated the height of the desk.

@fig-office_measuring_bottle shows how to estimate the height of the
bottle.

![](figures/single_view_3d/office_measuring_bottle-1.png){width="85%"}

As before, we will project the bottle height on the reference line on
the corner of the bookshelf. To do this we need to find two vertically
aligned parallel 3D lines that connect the bottle's top and bottom
points with the bookshelf. The first line, $\boldsymbol{l}_1$, is the
line connecting the bottom of the bottle, $\mathbf{g}_e$, and the point
$\mathbf{b}$. These two points are at the same height from the ground
plane as $\mathbf{b}$ corresponds to the top of the desk and
$\mathbf{g}_e$ is the point of the bottle that is in contact with the
top of the desk. The intersection of the line $\boldsymbol{l}_1$ with
the horizon line $\mathbf{h}$ give us point $\mathbf{a}$. Connecting
point $\mathbf{a}$ with the top of the bottle, point $\mathbf{t}_e$,
gives us the second line, $\boldsymbol{l}_2$. The intersection of this
line with the reference bookshelf line is the point $\mathbf{c}$. The
distance between the point $\mathbf{c}$ and the ground in 3D is the sum
$h_{\text{bookshelf}}+h_{\text{desk}}$. Writing everything into a
compact equation results in:
$$\mathbf{c} = (((\mathbf{g}_e \times \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{h}) \times \mathbf{t}_e) \times (\mathbf{g}_b \times \mathbf{t}_b)$$
Note that this equation relies on having computed $\mathbf{b}$ first.

Using the cross-ratio invariant we arrive to the following equation:
$$h_{\text{bottle}} =
h_{\text{bookshelf}}  \frac{\left| \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{g}_b \right| \left| \mathbf{t}_b - \mathbf{v}_3  \right|}{\left| \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{v}_3 \right| \left| \mathbf{t}_b - \mathbf{g}_b \right| }  - h_{\text{desk}}$$
This last equation shows how the height of the bottle is estimated by
propagating information from the ground via its supporting object, the
desk. Learning based approaches that estimated 3D from single images
will have to perform such propagation implicitly. The result that we get
is $h_{\text{bottle}} \simeq 27.6$ cm which is close to the real height
of 25.5 cm.

This procedure highlights the importance of the correct parsing of the
**supported-by hierarchy** between objects in the scene. 

## 3D Metrology from a Single View

In the previous section we showed how to use a reference object to
measure other objects. Let's now discuss a more general framework to
locate 3D points @criminisi1999accurate.

The office picture from @fig-office_world_calibration shows the
projection of the 3D coordinates frame into the image plane. The axes
directions are aligned with the three dominant orthogonal orientations
present in the scene and are aligned with the image vanishing points. We
will show how can we use the world-coordinates in order to extract 3D
object locations from a single image.

![](figures/single_view_3d/office_world_calibration-1.png){width=".7"}

In this section we will describe first how to calibrate the projected
world-coordinate axes in the image plane and then we will show how to
transport points into the 3D world axes in order to measure object sizes
and points locations.

### Calibration of the Projected World Axis

Where should we position the tick marks that correspond to 1, 2, 3, \...
meters from the origin on each axis in @fig-office_world_calibration?
Simply placing them at evenly spaced intervals along the axis in the
image won't be correct. Due to geometric distortion introduced by
perspective projection, the tick marks are not evenly spaced within the
image plane. This distortion affects each axis in a distinct manner.

Let's start assuming we know the location of some arbitrary 3D distance
to the origin on each axis that we will denote by $\alpha_X$, $\alpha_Y$
and $\alpha_Z$. The question is, where do we place the ticks for
$k\alpha_X$, $k\alpha_Y$ and $k\alpha_Z$ for all $k$? We will use the
cross-ratio to calibrate the projection of the world coordinate system
in the image plane. For doing this we will need the location of the
horizon line of a reference plane (i.e. the ground plane), the position
of the orthogonal vanishing point and the real measure of one object in
the scene.

As shown in @fig-axis_calibration_procedurea we can use the cross-ratio
to estimate the location of the points $Y= k \alpha_X$ where $\alpha_X$
is an arbitrary constant as shown in @fig-axis_calibration_procedureb,
and the corresponding image location $r$, for $k=1$, is chosen
arbitrarily as shown in @fig-axis_calibration_procedurea. Due to
perspective projection, the image projection of the point
$Y= k \alpha_X$ will not be evenly spaced in the image. In this
particular example we chose the orientation of the world axis in image
coordinates to be aligned with the location of the vanishing points.

In order to calibrate the axis we need to know the dimensions of an
object in the scene. We need measurements along the three axis. In this
example, we used the bookshelf height (197 cm) and the radius of the
table base (50 cm). Using these reference measurements we can solve for
the image locations of the ticks $\alpha_X=\alpha_Y=\alpha_Z=1$ m.

@fig-office_all_calibrated_box shows the final calibrated axes with
ticks placed each 50 cm along each of the three axes.

From this calibrated system we can directly read the height of the
camera. The location of the camera coincides with the location of the
horizon line because, in this example, the ground plane is horizontal.
It seems that the center of the camera is approximately 163 cm above the
ground.

There are many ways in which we can arrive to the same result.

### Locating a 3D Point

In the absence of any other information, we can not recover the 3D
location of a single point $\mathbf{P}$ from a single view as
illustrated in @fig-locating_a_3d_pointa. But real world scenes are
composed by a multitude of objects providing context, which allows
solving the 3D estimation problem even with just a single image. In the
previous section we showed how to estimate the height of an object, here
we show how to estimated the 3D coordinates of a point.

The basic procedure is illustrated in @fig-locating_a_3d_pointb. The
trick consists in using context (what object is the point part of, where
is the horizon line of the scene and where are the vanishing points) to
estimate 3D from a single image. It suffices to know that the point
$\mathbf{P}$ belongs to an object that is in contact with the ground and
the geometry of this object provides the information to localize the
projection of the point $\mathbf{P}$ on the ground plane, which we
denote with $\mathbf{G}$.

![](figures/single_view_3d/locating_a_3d_point-1.png){width="100%"}

Once we know the image location of the projection of the 3D point
$\mathbf{P}$ to the ground, $\mathbf{G}$, we can project this point to
the world-coordinate axis. To estimate the $Y$-coordinate we use a
similar method as the one described in the previous section. We first
find the line, $\boldsymbol{l}_3$, that passes by the point $\mathbf{G}$
and the origin, and then find the intersection with the horizon line,
giving the point $\mathbf{v}$. Next, find the line, $\boldsymbol{l}_4$,
that passes by $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{P}$. The intersection of
$\boldsymbol{l}_4$ with the $Y_w$-axis gives the coordinate $P_y$. The
$P_x$ and $P_z$ coordinates can be obtained by connecting $\mathbf{G}$
with the vanishing points $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$.

Here we have been using the ground plane as a reference. But the same
idea can be applied if we know the projection of the point $\mathbf{P}$
into another plane with a known horizon line.

In summary, we can recover the location of the 3D point from a single
image by propagating information from the calibrated world-coordinate
axis using the vanishing points that are aligned with the axis.

## Camera Calibration from Vanishing Points

In the previous chapters, we have seen different methods to calibrate a
camera. We saw that we could do it by taking pictures of a calibration
pattern, and we also showed that we can extract both the intrinsics and
extrinsics from a set of 3D points and their image correspondences. Here
we will see a different method that uses only the vanishing points to
extract the camera parameters; note that this method will only work
under some conditions.

The first step consists in finding the vanishing points in the image.
Let's use the office picture from @fig-vanishing_lines. In this
particular scene there are many parallel lines in 3D, and they also
happen to be parallel to the three directions we used to define the
world coordinates system. Therefore, the three vanishing points are also
aligned with the world coordinate axis.

Let's assume that we have three orthogonal vanishing directions. That is
the vectors $\mathbf{D}_1$, $\mathbf{D}_2$, and $\mathbf{D}_3$ are
orthogonal in 3D. From equation (@eq-vanishing_projection), the
vanishing points measured on the image are the result of projecting
$\mathbf{D}_1$, $\mathbf{D}_2$, and $\mathbf{D}_3$ into the image using
the unknown camera projection matrix. We will use the vanishing points
to derive a set of constraints on the projection matrix. To do this, we
start by inverting equation (@eq-vanishing_projection):
$$\mathbf{D}_i = \mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_i
$${#eq-vanishing_projection_inv} Because the vectors $\mathbf{D}_i$ are
orthogonal, we have that $\mathbf{D}_i^{\mathsf{T}} \mathbf{D}_j = 0$
for $i \neq j$. Therefore, we can write:
$$\mathbf{D}_i^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{D}_j = \mathbf{v}_i^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{K}^{-\mathsf{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-\mathsf{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_j 
$${#eq-vanishing_projection_constraint} As $\mathbf{R}$ is an orthonormal
matrix, we have that
$\mathbf{R}^{-\mathsf{T}} \mathbf{R}^{-1} = \mathbf{I}$, resulting in a
relationship that only depends on the intrinsic camera parameters
$\mathbf{K}$:
$$\mathbf{D}_i^T \mathbf{D}_j = \mathbf{v}_i^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{K}^{-\mathsf{T}} \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_j = 0
$${#eq-vanishing_projection_constraint}

It is useful to define the following matrix:
$$\mathbf{W} =  \mathbf{K}^{-\mathsf{T}} \mathbf{K}^{-1}$$ This is also
known as the **conic matrix** and it has lots of different properties
@Hartley2004. 

If we assume that the skew parameter of the intrinsic camera matrix is
zero, then the matrix $\mathbf{W}$ has a very particular structure and
it has only four different values: $$\mathbf{W} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a & 0 & b\\
    0 & a & c\\
    b & c & d
    \end{bmatrix}$$ Using equation
(@eq-vanishing_projection_constraint), we can derive a linear constraint
on the values $a,b,c,d$ for each pair of vanishing points. Defining the
vector $\mathbf{w}=[a~b~c~d]^\mathsf{T}$, we can rewrite equation
(@eq-vanishing_projection_constraint) into a system of linear equations
that has the form: $$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{w} = 0$$

The linear equation can be solved with the singular value decomposition
(SVD) and the result is the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue.

Once we have $\mathbf{W}$, we can find $\mathbf{K}$ by using the
Cholesky factorization, which decomposes a matrix as the product of an
upper triangular matrix and its transpose. The last step is to normalize
the result by normalizing all the matrix values so that the value on the
bottom-right side is 1. In our running example of the office picture, we
get the following solution for $\mathbf{K}$: $$\mathbf{K} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3{,}054.6    &      0    &     1{,}999.4\\
       0    &       3{,}054.6    &     1{,}528.3\\
       0    &          0    &          1
    \end{bmatrix}$$



We can now compare this result with the one we obtained when we (1) used
the physical camera parameters (section
[\[sec-simple_unreliable_calibration_method\]](#sec:simple_unreliable_calibration_method){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-simple_unreliable_calibration_method"}); (2) used a
calibration pattern (section
[\[sec-simple_unreliable_calibration_method\]](#sec:simple_unreliable_calibration_method){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-simple_unreliable_calibration_method"}); and (3) used a
collection of 3D points and the corresponding image locations (section
[\[sec-a_toy_example\]](#sec:a_toy_example){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-a_toy_example"}). We can see that in all cases we get
similar results, although, not identical.

## Concluding Remarks

In this chapter we have shown how to use geometric image features
(vanishing points, horizon line) and projective invariants (such as the
cross-ratio) to estimate 3D scene properties from a single image.
However, most of the steps required some manual intervention. All of
those steps can be performed in a fully automatic way by training
detectors to localize the full extend of an object as we will discuss in
chapter
[\[chapter-object_recognition\]](#chapter:object_recognition){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-object_recognition"} and detecting points of contact
between objects.

One of the key insights from this chapter is that a single images
contain a lot of information that, in most cases, is enough to estimate
metric 3D information from a single 2D image. In the next chapter we
will discuss learning-based methods for 3D estimation from images.
