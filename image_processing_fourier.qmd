# Fourier Analysis {#sec-fourier_analysis}

## Introduction

We need a more precise language to talk about the effect of linear
filters, and the different image components, than to say "sharp" and
"blurry" parts of the image. The Fourier transform provides that
precision. By analogy with temporal frequencies, which describe how
quickly signals vary over time, a **spatial frequency** describes how
quickly a signal varies over space. The Fourier transform lets us
describe a signal as a sum of complex exponentials, each of a different
spatial frequency.

Fourier transforms are the basis of a number of computer vision
approaches and are an important tool to understand images and how linear
spatially invariant filters transform images. There are also important
to understand modern representations such as positional encoding
popularized by transformers @vaswani2017attention.

## Image Transforms

Sometimes it is useful to transform the image pixels into another
representation that might reveal image properties that can be useful for
solving vision tasks. Before we saw that linear filtering is a useful
way of transforming an image. Linear image transforms with the form
$\mathbf{x} =  \mathbf{H} \boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}$ can be thought
of as a way of changing the initial pixels representation of
$\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}$ into a different representation in
$\mathbf{x}$.

:::{.column-margin}
We use $\mathbf{x}$ to denote an intermediate representation. The representation might not be an image.
:::

This representation is specially interesting when it can
be inverted so that the original pixels can be recovered as
$\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}=  \mathbf{H}^{-1} \mathbf{x}$. The
Fourier transform is one of those representations. A useful
representation $\mathbf{x}$ should have a number of interesting
properties not immediately available in the original pixels of
$\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}$.

## Fourier Series

In 1822, French mathematician and engineer Joseph Fourier, as part of
his work on the study on heat propagation, showed that any periodic
signal could be written as an infinite sum of trigonometric functions
(cosine and sine functions). His ideas were published in his famous book
*Theorie de la Chaleur* @Fourier09, and the **Fourier series** has
become one of the most important mathematical tools in science and
engineering.

Fourier showed that any function, $\ell(t)$ defined in the interval
$t \in (0,\pi)$, could be expressed as an infinite linear combination of
harmonically related sinusoids,
$$\ell(t) = a_1 \sin (t) + a_2 \sin (2t) + a_3 \sin (3t) + ...$$ andthat the value of the coefficients $a_n$ could be computed as the area
of the curve $\ell(t) \sin (nt)$. Precisely,
$$a_n = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi  \ell(t) \sin (nt) dt$$ However, the
sum is only guaranteed to converge to the function $\ell(t)$ within the
interval $t \in (0,\pi)$. In fact, the resulting sum, for any values
$a_n$, is a **periodic function** with period $2\pi$ and is
anti-symmetric with respect to the origin, $t=0$.

One of Fourier's original examples of **sine series** is the expansion
of the ramp signal $\ell(t)=t/2$. This series was first introduced by
Euler. Fourier showed that his theory explained why a ramp could be
written as the following infinite sum:
$$\frac{1}{2} t =  \sin (t) - \frac{1}{2}  \sin (2t) + \frac{1}{3} \sin (3t) - \frac{1}{4}  \sin (4t) + ...$$
The result of this series approximates the ramp with increasing accuracy
as we add more terms. The plots in @fig-FourierSeries6 show each of the
weighted sine functions (on top) and the resulting partial sum (bottom
graphs). We can see how adding **higher frequency** sines adds more
details to the resulting function making it closer to the ramp. These
plots show the signal in the interval $t \in (-4 \pi, 4 \pi)$ to reveal
the periodic nature of the result of the sine series.


![Reconstruction of a ramp with the first five sine functions.](figures/Image_processing_fourier/FourierSeries6.png){#fig-FourierSeries6}

It is useful to think of the **Fourier series** of a signal as a
**change of representation** as shown in
@fig-FourierSeries5_representation. Instead of representing the signal
by the sequence of values specified by the original function $\ell(t)$,
the same function can be represented by the infinite sequence of
coefficients $a_n$. The coefficients $a_n$ give us an alternative
description of the function $\ell(t)$ and the rest of this chapter will
be devoted to understand what this **transformation** has to offer.

![Two representations for the ramp function. (left) Time domain. (right) Fourier domain with coefficients of the sine series.](figures/Image_processing_fourier/FourierSeries5_representation.png){width="90%" #fig-FourierSeries5_representation}


Fourier series can also be written as sums of different sets of harmonic
functions. For instance, using cosine functions we can describe the ramp
function also as:
$$\frac{1}{2} t =  \frac{\pi}{4}  - \frac{2}{\pi} \cos (t) - \frac{2}{3^2 \pi}  \cos (3t) - \frac{2}{5^2 \pi}  \cos (5t) - ...$$
The cosine and sine series of the same function are only equal in the
interval $t \in (0, \pi)$, and result in different periodic extensions
outside that interval.

The fields of signal and image processing have introduced different
types of Fourier series. In the next sections we will study how these
series are applied to describe discrete images using discrete sine and
cosine functions and then we will focus on using complex exponentials.
The representation using Fourier series is important for studying linear systems and convolutions.

## Continuous and Discrete Waves

Now that we have seen the importance of sine waves as a tool to
represent signals, let's describe them in a bit more detail.

The **continuous time sine wave** is
$$s\left(t\right) = A \sin\left(w ~t - \theta \right)$$ where $A$ is the
**amplitude**, $w$ is the **frequency**, and $\theta$ is the **phase**.
The wave signal is periodic with a period $T=2 \pi / w$.

:::{.column-margin}
![](figures/Image_processing_fourier/amplitudeandperiod.png)
:::

In discrete time, the **discrete time sine wave** is as follows
$$s\left[n\right] = A \sin\left(w ~n  - \theta \right)$$ Note that the
discrete sine wave will not be periodic for any arbitrary value of $w$.
A discrete signal $\ell\left[n\right]$ is periodic, if there exists
$T \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$\ell\left[n\right] = \ell\left[n+mT\right]$ for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
For the discrete sine (and cosine) wave to be periodic the frequency has
to be $w = 2 \pi K / N$ for $K,N \in \mathbb{N}$. If $K/N$ is an
irreducible fraction, then the period of the wave will be $T = N$
samples. Although $\theta$ can have any value, here we will consider
only the values $\theta=0$ and $\theta = \pi/2$, which correspond to the
sine and cosine waves, respectively.

In general, to make explicit the periodicity of the wave we will use the
form:
$$s_k\left[n\right] = \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi}{N} \, k \, n \right)$$

The same applies for the cosine:
$$c_k\left[n\right] = \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi}{N} \,k\,n \right)$$ This
particular notation makes sense when considering the set of periodic
signals with period $N$, or the set of signals with finite support
signals of length $N$ with $n \in \left[0, N-1\right]$. In such a case,
$k \in \left[1, N/2\right]$ denotes the frequency (i.e., the number of
wave cycles that will occur within the region of support). Note that if
$k=0$ then $s\left[n\right]$ = 0 and $c\left[n\right]=1$ for all $n$.
One can also verify that $c_{N-k} = c_k$, and $s_{N-k} = -s_k$.
Therefore, for frequencies $k>N/2$ we find the same set of waves as the
ones in the interval $s \in \left[1, N/2\right]$. @fig-contsignal shows
some examples.


![Sine and cosine waves with $A=1$ and $N=20$. Each row corresponds to $k=1$, $k=2$ and $k=3$. Note that for $k=3$ the waves oscillates three times in the interval $\left[0,N-1\right]$, but the samples in each oscillation are not identical, and it is only truly periodic once every $N$ samples. This is because $3/20$ is an irreducible fraction.](figures/Image_processing_fourier/contsignal.png){width="80%" #fig-contsignal}

### Sines and Cosines in 2D

The same analysis can be extended to two dimensions (2D). In 2D, the
discrete sine and cosine waves are as follows:
$$s_{u,v}\left[n,m\right] = A \sin \left(2 \pi \left( \frac{u\,n}{N}  + \frac{v\,m}{M}  \right) \right)$$
$$c_{u,v}\left[n,m\right] = A \cos \left(2 \pi \left( \frac{u\,n}{N}  + \frac{v\,m}{M}  \right) \right)$$
where $A$ is the amplitude and $u$ and $v$ are the two spatial
frequencies and define how fast or slow the waves change along the
spatial dimensions $n$ and $m$. @fig-disc2Dsignal shows some examples.


![2D sine waves with $N=M=20$. The frequency values are (a) $u=2, v=0$; (b) $u=3, v=1$; (c) $u=7,v=-5$.](figures/image_processing_fourier/disc2Dsignal.png){#fig-disc2Dsignal}

### Complex Exponentials

Another important signal is the complex exponential wave:
$$e_{u}\left[n\right] = \exp \left(2 \pi j   \frac{u\, n}{N}   \right)$$

Complex exponentials are related to cosine and sine waves by Euler's
formula: $$
\exp \left(j a\right) = \cos (a) + j \sin (a)$${#eq-euler} @fig-complexexponential
shows the one dimensional (1D) discrete complex exponential function
(for $v=0$). As the values are complex, the plot shows in the $x$-axis
the real component and in the $y$-axis the imaginary component. As $n$
goes from 0 to $N-1$ the function rotates along the complex circle of
unit magnitude.


![Complex exponential wave with (a) $N=40$, $k=1$, $A=1$; and (b) $N=40$, $k=3$, $A=1$. The red and green curves show the real and imaginary waves. The black line is the complex exponential. The dots correspond to the discrete samples.](figures/image_processing_fourier/complexexponential.png){width="80%" #fig-complexexponential}

In 2D, the complex exponential wave is
$$e_{u,v}\left[n,m\right] = \exp \left(2 \pi j \left(  \frac{u\, n}{N}  + \frac{v\,m}{M}  \right) \right)$$where $u$ and $v$ are the two spatial frequencies. Note that complex
exponentials in 2D are separable. This means they can be written as the
product of two 1D signals:
$$e_{u,v}\left[n,m\right]   = e_{u}\left[n\right] e_{v}\left[m\right]$$

A remarkable property is that the complex exponentials form an
orthogonal basis for discrete signals and images of finite length. For
images of size $N \times M$,
$$\left<e_{u,v}, e_{u',v'} \right> = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} e_{u,v}\left[n,m\right] e^*_{u',v'}\left[n,m\right] = MN \delta \left[u-u'\right]\delta \left[v-v'\right]$$
Therefore, any finite length discrete image can be decomposed as a
linear combination of complex exponentials.

## The Discrete Fourier Transform

In this chapter we will focus on the discrete Fourier transform as it
provides important tools to understand the behavior of signals and
systems (e.g., sampling and convolutions). For a more detailed study of
other transforms and the foundations of Fourier series we refer the
reader to other specialized books in signal and image processing .

### Discrete Fourier Transform and Inverse Transform

The **Discrete Fourier Transform** (DFT) transforms an image
$\ell\left[n,m \right]$, of finite size $N \times M$, into the complex
image Fourier transform $\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$ as:
$$\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] =  
\mathcal{F} \left\{ \ell\left[n,m \right] \right\}
=
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \, \ell\left[n,m \right] 
\exp{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u\, n}{N} + \frac{v\, m}{M} \right) \right)}
$${#eq-fourier} We will call $\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$ the Fourier
transform of $\ell\left[m,n \right]$. We will often represent the
relationship between the signal as its transform as:
$$\ell\left[n,m \right] \xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$$By applying $\frac{1}{MN} \sum_{u=0}^{M-1} \sum_{v=0}^{N-1}$ to both
sides of equation (@eq-fourier) and exploiting the orthogonality between
distinct Fourier basis elements, we find the **inverse Fourier
transform** relation $$\ell\left[n,m \right] = 
\mathcal{F}^{-1} \left\{ \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] \right\}
=
\frac{1}{NM} \sum_{u=0}^{N-1} \sum_{v=0}^{M-1} \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] 
\exp{ \left(+2\pi j \left(\frac{u\, n}{N} + \frac{v\, m}{M} \right) \right) }
$${#eq-inversefourier}

As we can see from the inverse transform equation, we rewrite the image,
instead of as a sum of offset pixel values, as a sum of complex
exponentials, each at a different frequency, called a spatial frequency
for images because they describe how quickly things vary across space.
From the inverse transform formula, we see that to construct an image
from a Fourier transform, $\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$, we just add in
the corresponding amount of that particular complex exponential
(conjugated).

As $\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$ is obtained as a sum of complex
exponential with a common period of $N,M$ samples, the function
$\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$ is also periodic:
$\mathscr{L}\left[u+aN,v+bM \right] = \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$ for
any $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Also the result of the inverse DFT is a
periodic image. Indeed you can verify from equation (@eq-inversefourier)
that $\ell\left[n+aN,m+bM \right] = \ell\left[n,m \right]$ for any
$a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Using the fact that $e_{N-u, M-v} = e_{-u,-v}$, another equivalent way
to write for the Fourier transform is to sum over the frequency interval
$\left[-N/2, N/2\right]$ and $\left[-M/2, M/2\right]$. This is
especially useful for the inverse that can be written as:
$$\ell\left[n,m \right] = \frac{1}{NM} \sum_{u=-N/2}^{N/2} \sum_{v=-M/2}^{M/2} \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]\exp{ \left(+2\pi j \left(\frac{u\, n}{N} + \frac{v\, m}{M} \right) \right) }
$${#eq-inversefourier2}

This formulation allows us to arrange the coefficients in the complex
plane so that the zero frequency, or DC, coefficient is at the center.
Slow, large variations correspond to complex exponentials of frequencies
near the origin. If the amplitudes of the complex conjugate exponentials
are the same, then their sum will represent a cosine wave; if their
amplitudes are opposite, it will be a sine wave. Frequencies further
away from the origin represent faster variation with movement across
space. The DFT and its inverse in 1D are defined in the same way as
shown in table
[\[table:tableFamilyFT\]](#table:tableFamilyFT){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:tableFamilyFT"}.

One very important property is that the decomposition of a signal into a
sum of complex exponentials is unique: there is a unique linear
combination of the exponentials that will result in a given signal.



:::{.column-margin}
The DFT became very popular thanks to the **Fast Fourier Transform** (FFT) algorithm. The most common FFT algorithm is the Cooley–Tukey algorithm @Cooley1965 that reduces the computation cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$.
:::

### Matrix Form of the Fourier Transform

As the DFT is a linear transform we can also write the DFT in matrix
form, with one basis per row. In 1D, the matrix for the DFT is as
follows:

$$\mathbf{F} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & \dots & 1\\ %u=0
1 & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{1}{N} \right)} & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{2}{N} \right)} & \dots & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{N-1}{N} \right)}\\ %u=1
1 & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{2}{N} \right)} & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{4}{N} \right)} & \dots & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{2\, (N-1)}{N} \right)}\\ %u=2
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & ~ & \vdots \\
1 & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{(N-1)}{N} \right)} & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{(N-1)\, 2}{N} \right)} & \dots & \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{(N-1)\, (N-1)}{N} \right)}\
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

Each entry in the matrix is
$\mathbf{F}_{u,n} = \exp{ \left(-2\pi j \frac{u\, n}{N} \right)}$, with
$u$ indexing rows and $n$ indexing columns. Note that $\mathbf{F}$ is a
symmetric matrix. The inverse of the DFT is the complex conjugate:
$\mathbf{F}^{-1} = \mathbf{F}^{*}$.

Working in 1D, as we did before, allows us to visualize the
transformation matrix. @fig-colorDFT shows a color visualization of the
complex-value matrix for the 1D DFT, which when used as a multiplicand
yields the Fourier transform of 1D vectors. Many Fourier transform
properties and symmetries can be observed from inspecting that matrix.

\caption{Visualization of the discrete Fourier transform as a matrix.  The signal to be
 transformed forms the entries of the column vector at right.  The
 complex values of the Fourier transform matrix are indicated by the color,

 values indicate zero.

### Visualizing the Fourier Transform

When computing the DFT of a real image, we will not be able to write the
analytic form of the result, but there are a number of properties that
will help us to interpret the result. @fig-DFT_a shows the Fourier
transform of a $64 \times 64$ resolution image of a cube. As the DFT
results in a complex representation, there are two possible ways of
writing the result. Using the real and imaginary components:
$$\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] = Re \left\{\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] \right\}  + j \, Imag \left\{\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] \right\}$$
where $Re$ and $Imag$ denote the real and imaginary part of each Fourier
coefficient. Or using a polar decomposition:
$$\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]  = A \left[u,v \right] \, \exp{\left( j \, \theta\left[u,v \right]  \right)}$$
where $A \left[u,v \right] \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the amplitude and
$\theta \left[u,v \right] \in \left[-\pi, \pi \right]$ is the phase.
@fig-DFT_a shows both decompositions of the Fourier transform.


![DFT of an image and visualization of (top) the real and imaginary components, and (bottom) the amplitude and phase  of the Fourier transform.](figures/Image_processing_fourier/dft_a.png){width="100%" #fig-DFT_a}


Upon first learning about Fourier transforms, it may be a surprise for
readers to learn that one can synthesize any image as a sum of complex
exponentials (i.e., sines and cosines). To help gain insight into how
that works, it is informative to show examples of partial sums of
complex exponentials. @fig-DFT_b shows partial sums of the Fourier
components of an image. In each partial sum of $N$ components, we use
the largest N components of the Fourier transform. Using the fact that
the Fourier basis functions are orthonormal, it is straightforward to
show that this is the best least-squares reconstruction possible from
each given number of Fourier basis components. This first image shows
what is reconstructed from the largest Fourier component which turns out
to be $\mathscr{L}\left[0,0 \right]$. This component encodes the DC
value of the image, therefore the resulting image is just a constant.
The next two components correspond to two complex conjugates of a very
slow varying wave. And so on. As more components get added, the figure
slowly emerges. In this example, the first 127 coefficients are
sufficient for recognizing this 64$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}64 resolution
image.

## Useful Transforms

It's useful to become adept at computing and manipulating simple Fourier
transforms. For some simple cases, we can compute the analytic form of
the Fourier transform.

### Delta Distribution

The Fourier transform of the delta function $\delta \left[n,m \right]$
is $$\mathcal{F} \left\{ \delta \left[n,m \right] \right\} = 
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \, \delta \left[n,m \right] 
\exp{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u\, n}{N} + \frac{v\, m}{M} \right) \right)} = 1$$
where the Fourier transform of the delta signal is 1.
$$\delta \left[n,m \right] \xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 1$$ If we think in
terms of the inverse Fourier transform, this means that if we sum all
the complex exponentials with a coefficient of 1, then all the values
will cancel but the one at the origin, which results in a delta
function:
$$\delta \left[n,m \right] = \frac{1}{NM} \sum_{u=-N/2}^{N/2} \sum_{v=-M/2}^{M/2}  
\exp{ \left(2\pi j \left(\frac{u\, n}{N} + \frac{v\, m}{M} \right) \right) }$$

### Cosine and Sine Waves

The Fourier transform of the cosine wave,
$\cos{ \left( 2\pi \left( \frac{u_0\, n}{N} + \frac{v_0\, m}{M} \right) \right) }$,
is: $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \, \cos{ \left( 2\pi \left( \frac{u_0 \, n}{N} + \frac{v_0 \, m}{M} \right) \right) }
\exp{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u\, n}{N} + \frac{v\, m}{M} \right) \right)} = \\ 
=\frac{1}{2} \left( \delta \left[u-u_0, v-v_0 \right] +  \delta \left[u+u_0, v+v_0 \right] \right)
\end{aligned}$$ This can be easily proven using Euler's equation
(@eq-euler) and the orthogonality between complex exponentials. This
results in the Fourier transform relationship:
$$\cos{ \left( 2\pi \left( \frac{u_0\, n}{N} + \frac{v_0\, m}{M} \right) \right) } 
\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 
\frac{1}{2} \left( \delta \left[u-u_0, v-v_0 \right] +  \delta \left[u+u_0, v+v_0 \right] \right)$$

And for the sine wave,
$\sin{ \left( 2\pi \left( \frac{u_0\, n}{N} + \frac{v_0 m}{M} \right) \right) }$,
we have a similar relationship:

$$\sin{ \left( 2\pi \left( \frac{u_0\, n}{N} + \frac{v_0 m}{M} \right) \right) } 
\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 
\frac{1}{2j} \left( \delta \left[u-u_0, v-v_0 \right] - \delta \left[u+u_0, v+v_0 \right]\right)$$

@fig-2ddftexampleswaves shows the DFT of several waves with different
frequencies and orientations.


![Some 2D Fourier transform pairs. Images are $64 \times 64$ pixels. The waves are cosine with frequencies $(1,2)$, $(5,0)$, $(10,7)$, $(11,-15)$.

@fig-2ddftexamples shows the 2D Fourier transforms of some periodic
signals. The depicted signals all happen to be symmetric about the
spatial origin. From the Fourier transform equation, one can show that
real and even input signals transform to real and even outputs. So for
the examples of @fig-2ddftexamples, we only show the magnitude of the
Fourier transform, which in this case is the absolute value of the real
component of the transform, and the imaginary component happens to be
zero for the signals we'll examine. Also, all these images but the last
one are separable (they can be written as the product of two 1D
signals). Therefore, their DFT is also the product of 1D DFTs.

  the support of the image in one domain gets larger, the magnitude in
  the other domain becomes more localized.  A line transforms to a
  line oriented perpendicularly to the first. Images are $64 \times 64$ pixels, origin is in the center.

### Box Function {#sec-box_function}

The box function is a very useful function that we will use several
times in this book. It is good to be familiar with its Fourier transform
and how to compute it. The box function is defined as follows:
$$\text{box}_{L} \left[n \right] = 
\begin{cases}
    1       & \quad \text{if } -L \leq n \leq L  \\
    0       & \quad \text{otherwise.} 
  \end{cases}$$

The box function takes values of 1 inside the interval
$\left[ -L,L \right]$ and it is 0 outside. The duration of the box is
$2L+1$.

It is useful to think of the box function as a finite length signal of
length $N$ and to visualize its periodic extension outside of that
interval. The following plot shows the box function for $L=5$ and
$N=32$. In this plot, the box signal is defined between $-N/2=-16$ and
$N/2-1=15$ and the rest is its periodic extension.

We will compute here the DFT of the finite length box function, with a
length $N$. To compute the DFT we use the DFT definition and change the
interval of the sum making use of the periodic nature of the terms
inside the sum: 

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F} \left\{ \text{box}_{L} \left[n \right] \right\} &=& 
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \, \text{box}_{L} \left[n \right] 
\exp{ \left( -2\pi j \frac{u\, n}{N} \right)} \\
&=& \sum_{n=-L}^{L} \,
\exp{ \left( -2\pi j \frac{u\, n}{N} \right)} 
\end{aligned}$${#eq-boxdftderivation}

We can use the equation of the sum of a geometric series:
$$\sum_{n=-L}^{L} a^n = a^{-L} \sum_{n=0}^{2L} a^n = a^{-L} \frac{1-a^{2L+1}}{1-a} = \frac{a^{-(2L+1)/2}-a^{(2L+1)/2}}{a^{-1/2}-a^{1/2}}$$where $a$ is a constant. With
$a = \exp{ \left( -2\pi j \frac{u}{N} \right)}$ we can write the sum in
equation (@eq-boxdftderivation) as

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=-L}^{L} \,
\exp{ \left( -2\pi j \frac{u\, n}{N} \right)} & = & 
\frac{\exp{ \left( \pi j \frac{u(2L+1)}{N} \right)} - \exp{ \left( -\pi j \frac{u(2L+1)}{N} \right)}}

& = & \frac{\sin \left( \pi u(2L+1)/N \right)}{\sin \left( \pi u/N \right)}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-discrete_sinc_function}

This last function in equation (@eq-discrete_sinc_function) gets the
special name of **discrete sinc** function. 

In summary, we get that The DFT of the box function is the discrete sinc
function: 
$$\text{box}_{L} \left[n \right]\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 
\frac{\sin \pi u (2L+1)/N}{\sin \pi u/N}
$$ 

We will denote the DFT of the box function, $\text{box}_{L} \left[n \right]$, capitalizing the first
letter, $\text{Box}_{L} \left[u \right]$. This function has its maximum
value at $u=0$. The DFT, $\text{Box}_{L} \left[u \right]$, is a
symmetric real function. The following plot (@fig-boxfilterdft) shows
the DFT of the box with $L=5$, and $N=32$. One period of the DFT is
contained in the interval $\left[ -16, 15 \right]$ and the rest is a
periodic extension.

Now that we know how to compute the DFT of the 1D box, we can easily
extend it to the 2D case. A 2D box is a separable function and can be
written as the product of two box functions,
$\text{box}_{L_n, L_m} \left[n,m\right] = \text{box}_{L_n} \left[n\right] \text{box}_{L_m}\left[m\right]$.
The DFT is the product of the two DFTs,
$$\text{Box}_{L_n, L_m} \left[ u,v \right] = \text{Box}_{L_n} \left[ u\right] \text{Box}_{L_m} \left[ v\right].$$

@fig-2ddftexamples shows several DFTs of 2D boxes of different sizes
and aspect ratios.

## Discrete Fourier Transform Properties {#section:DFTproperties}

It is important to be familiar with the properties for the DFT. 

@tbl-dft summarizes some important transforms and
properties.

### Linearity

The Fourier transform and its inverse are linear transformations:
$$\alpha \ell_1 \left[n,m \right] + \beta \ell_2 \left[ n,m \right]  
\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 
\alpha \mathscr{L}_1 \left[u,v \right] + \beta \mathscr{L}_2 \left[ u,v \right]$$
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers. This property can be
easily proven from the definition of the DFT. @fig-colorDFT shows a
color visualization of the complex-value matrix for the 1D DFT.

### Separability

An image is separable if it can be written as the product of two 1D
signals,
$\ell\left[n,m \right] = \ell_1\left[n \right] \ell_2\left[m \right]$.
If an image is separable, then its Fourier transform is separable:
$\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] = \mathscr{L}_1 \left[u \right] \mathscr{L}_2 \left[v \right]$



### Parseval's Theorem

As the DFT is a change of basis, the dot product between two signals and
the norm of a vector is preserved (up to a constant factor) after the
basis change. This is stated by Parseval's theorem:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \,  \ell_1 \left[n,m \right] \ell_2^* \left[n,m \right] = \frac{1}{NM}\sum_{u=0}^{N-1} \sum_{v=0}^{M-1} \,  \mathscr{L}_1 \left[u,v \right] \mathscr{L}_2^* \left[u,v \right]$$
In particular, if $\ell_1=\ell_2$ this reduces to the **Plancherel
theorem**:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \,  \| \ell\left[n,m \right] \|^2 = \frac{1}{NM}\sum_{u=0}^{N-1} \sum_{v=0}^{M-1} \,  \| \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right] \|^2$$
This relationship is important because it tells us that the energy of a
signal can be computed as the sum of the squared magnitude of the values
of its Fourier transform.

### Convolution

Consider a signal $\ell_{\texttt{out}}$ that is the result of applying
(circular) convolution of two signals, $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, both of
size $N \times M$: $$\ell_{\texttt{out}}= \ell_1 \circ \ell_2$$

The question is; how does the Fourier transform of the signal
$\ell_{\texttt{out}}$ relates to the Fourier transforms of the two
signals $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$?



:::{.column-margin}
The relationship between the convolution and the
Fourier transform is probably the most important property of the Fourier
transform and you should be familiar with it.
:::



If we take the Fourier transform of both sides, and use the definition
of the Fourier transform, we obtain $$\begin{split}
\mathscr{L}_{\texttt{out}}\left[u,v \right] & =  \mathcal{F}  \left\{ \ell_1 \circ_{N,M} \ell_2 \right\} \\
& =  
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}  \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} 
\left\{
\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \sum_{l=0}^{M-1} 
\ell_1 \left[n-k, m-l \right] \ell_2 \left[k,l \right]
\right\}
\exp \left(-2 \pi j \left(\frac{nu}{N} + \frac{mv}{M} \right) \right)
\end{split}$$ In these sums, the finite signal
$\ell_1 \left[n, m \right]$ of size $N \times M$ is extended
periodically infinitely. The periodic extension allows us to drop the
modulo operators. Changing the dummy variables in the sums (introducing
$n' = n - k$ and $m' = m - l$), we have
$$\mathscr{L}_{\texttt{out}}\left[u,v \right] =
\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \sum_{l=0}^{M-1} 
\ell_2 \left[k,l \right]
\sum_{n'=-k}^{N-k-1}  \sum_{m'=-l}^{M-l-1} 
\ell_1 \left[n', m' \right] 
\exp{ \left(-2 \pi j \left(\frac{(n'+k)u}{N} + \frac{(m'+l)v}{M} \right) \right)}$$
Recognizing that the last two summations give the DFT of
$x\left[n,m\right]$, using circular boundary conditions, gives
$$\mathscr{L}_{\texttt{out}}\left[u,v \right] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \sum_{l=0}^{M-1}  \mathscr{L}_1 \left[u,v\right] \exp{ \left(-2 \pi j \left(\frac{ku}{N}+\frac{lv}{M} \right ) \right)} \ell_2 \left[k,l\right]$$
Performing the DFT indicated by the second two summations gives the
desired result:
$$\mathscr{L}_{\texttt{out}}\left[u,v\right] = \mathscr{L}_1 \left[u,v\right] \mathscr{L}_2 \left[u,v\right]$$

Thus, the operation of a convolution, in the Fourier domain, is just a
multiplication of the Fourier transform of each term in the Fourier
domain: $$\ell_1 \left[n,m\right] \circ_{N,M} \ell_2 \left[n,m\right]
\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 
\mathscr{L}_1 \left[u,v\right] \mathscr{L}_2 \left[u,v\right]$$

The Fourier transform lets us characterize images by their spatial
frequency content. It's also the natural domain in which to analyze
space invariant linear processes, because the Fourier bases are the
eigenfunctions of all space invariant linear operators. In other words,
if you start with a complex exponential, and apply any linear, space
invariant operator to it, you always come out with a complex exponential
of that same frequency, but, in general, with some different amplitude
and phase.

This property lets us examine the operation of a filter on any image by
examining how it modulates the Fourier coefficients of any image.


:::{.column-margin}
Note that the autocorrelation function does not have
this property.
:::

We will discuss this in more detail in @sec-transfer_function.

### Dual Convolution {#section:dualconv}

Another common operation with working with images is to do products
between images. For instance, this might happen if we are applying a
mask to an image (which corresponds to multiplying the image by a mask
that has 0 in the pixels that we want to mask out).

It turns out that the Fourier transform of the product of two images is
the (circular) convolution of their DFTs:

$$\ell_1 \left[n,m\right] \ell_2 \left[n,m\right]
\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 
\frac{1}{NM} \mathscr{L}_1 \left[u,v\right] \circ \mathscr{L}_2 \left[u,v\right]$$
We leave the proof of this property to the reader.

### Shift Property, Translation in Space

A shift corresponds to a translation in space. This is a very common
operation that has a very particular influence on the Fourier transform
of the signal. It turns out that translating a signal in the spatial
domain, results in multiplying its Fourier transform by a complex
exponential.

To show this, consider an image $\ell\left[n,m \right]$, with Fourier
transform $\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$ and period $N,M$. When
displacing the image by $(n_0, m_0)$ pixels, we get
$\ell\left[n-n_0,m-m_0 \right]$ and its Fourier transform is:
$$
\begin{split}
\mathcal{F} \left\{ \ell\left[n-n_0,m-m_0 \right] \right\}
&= \\
 & = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \, \ell\left[n-n_0,m-m_0 \right] \exp{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u\, n}{N} + \frac{v\, m}{M} \right) \right)} = \\
& =  \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \, \ell\left[n,m \right] \exp{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u\, (n+n_0)}{N} + \frac{v\, (m+m_0)}{M} \right) \right)}  = \\
& =   \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]  \exp{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u\, n_0}{N} + \frac{v\, m_0}{M} \right) \right)}
   \end{split}$${#eq-shift} Note that as the signal $\ell$ and the complex
exponentials have the period $N,M$, we can change the sum indices over
any range of size $N \times M$ samples.

In practice, if we have an image and we apply a translation there will
be some boundary artifacts. So, in general, this property is only true
if we apply a **circular shift**, i.e., pixels that disappear on the
boundary due to the translation reappear on the other side. This is a
consequence of the periodic structure of the signal $\ell$ assumed by
the DFT. In practice, when the translation is due to the motion of the
camera, the shift will not be circular and new pixels will appear on the
image boundary. Therefore, the shift property will be only an
approximation.

To see how good of an approximation it is, let's look at one example of
a shift due to camera motion. @fig-shiftFT shows two images that
correspond to a translation with $n_0=16$ and $m_0=-4$. Note that at the
image boundaries, new pixels appear in (c) not visible in (a). As this
is not a pure circular translation, the result from equation (@eq-shift)
will not apply exactly. To verify equation (@eq-shift) let's look at the
real part of the DFT of each image shown in @fig-shiftFTb and (d). If
equation (@eq-shift) holds true, then the real part of the ratio between
the DFTs of the two translated images should be
$\cos{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u\, n_0}{N} + \frac{v\, m_0}{M} \right) \right)}$
with $N=M=128$ and $[n_0,m_0]=[16,-4]$. @fig-shiftFTf shows that the
real part of the ratio is indeed very close to a cosine, despite of the
boundary pixels which are responsible of the noise (the same is true for
the imaginary part). In fact, @fig-shiftFTe shows the inverse DFT of
the ratio between DFTs, considering both real and imaginary components,
which is very close to an impulse at $[16,-4]$.

![](figures/Image_processing_fourier/shiftFT2.png){width="100%"}

Locating the maximum on @fig-shiftFTf can be used to estimate the
displacement between two images when the translation corresponds to a
global translation. However, this method is not very robust and it is
rarely used in practice.

### Modulation, Translation in Frequency

If we multiply an image with a complex exponential, its Fourier
transform is translated, a property related to the previous one:

$$\ell\left[n,m \right]  \exp{ \left( -2\pi j \left( \frac{u_0\, n}{N} + \frac{v_0\, m}{M} \right) \right)}\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}}\mathscr{L}\left[u-u_0,v-v_0 \right]
$${#eq-modulation_exp} This can be proven using the dual convolution
property from section section
[1.7.5](#section:dualconv){reference-type="ref"
reference="section:dualconv"}. Note that now the result in equation
(@eq-modulation_exp) is not a real signal, and for this reason its
Fourier Transform does not have symmetries around $u,v=0$.

A related relationship is as follows:

$$\ell\left[n,m \right]  \cos{ \left( 2\pi j \left( \frac{u_0\, n}{N} + \frac{v_0\, m}{M} \right) \right)}\xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} 
\mathscr{L}\left[u-u_0,v-v_0 \right] + \mathscr{L}\left[u+u_0,v+v_0 \right]$$

Multiplying a signal by a wave is called signal modulation and it is one
of the basic operations in communications. It is also an important
property in image analysis and we will see its use later.

@fig-modulation shows an example of modulating an image of a stop sign
by multiplying by diagonal wave. The bottom row shows the corresponding
Fourier transforms.

![](figures/Image_processing_fourier/modulation.png){width="100%"}

Note that a shift and a modulation are equivalent operations in
different domains. A shift in space is a modulation in the frequency
domain and that a shift in frequency is a modulation in the spatial
domain.

## A Family of Fourier Transforms

The Fourier transform has a multitude of forms and it depends on the
conventions used. When you will read papers or other books that make use
of the Fourier transform, you will have to carefully check how are they
defining the Fourier transform before using it in your own analysis. The
important thing is to be consistent in the formulation.

The Fourier transform also will change depending on the type of signal
being analyzed. Although in this book we will mostly work with finite
length discrete signals and images, it is worth defining the Fourier
transform for other signals such as continuous signals (which are a
function of a continuous independent variable such as time), or infinite
length discrete signals for which the definition of the DFT will not be
convenient.

### Fourier Transform for Continuous Signals

The continuous domain is convenient when working with functions and
operations that are not defined in the discrete domain. For instance,
the derivative operator is well defined in the continuous domain but we
can only approximate it in the discrete domain. Another example is when
using the Gaussian distribution, which is defined as a continuous
function. For this reason, sometimes some formulation is easier when
done in the continuous domain.

For infinite length signals defined on the continuous domain, the
Fourier transform is defined as:

$$\mathscr{L}(w) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ell(t) \exp{ \left( - j w t \right)} \, dt 
$${#eq-contfourier} where $\mathscr{L}(w)$ is a continuous function on the
frequency $w$ (in radians). As before, this transform also has an
inverse. The inverse Fourier transform is as follows:

$$\ell(t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathscr{L}(w) \exp{ \left( j w t \right) } \, dw$${#eq-invcontfourier} Most of the properties that we have seen for the
DFT also apply to the continuous domain, replacing sums with integrals.

The convolution between two continuous signals is defined as
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}(t) =  \ell_1 \circ \ell_2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ell_1 (t-t') \ell_2(t') \, d t'$${#eq-contconv} Those definitions can be extended to 2D dimensions by
making all the integrals double and integrating across the spatial
variables $x$ and $y$. Although, in practice, images and filters will be
discrete signals, many times it is convenient to think of them as
continuous signals.

### Fourier Transform for Infinite Length Discrete Signals

Another useful tool is the Fourier transform for discrete signals with
infinite length. In this case, the sum becomes infinite, and by
replacing $w = 2 \pi u / N$ in equation (@eq-fourier), we can write:
$$\mathscr{L}(w) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \ell\left[n \right] \exp{(- j w n)}$$The frequency $w$ is now a continuous variable. The Fourier transform
$\mathscr{L}(w)$ is a periodic function with period $2 \pi$.

The inverse Fourier transform is
$$\ell\left[n \right] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{2 \pi} \mathscr{L}(w) \exp{(j w n)} d w$$
where the integral is done only in one of the periods.

Table
[\[table:tableFamilyFT\]](#table:tableFamilyFT){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:tableFamilyFT"} summarizes the three transforms we have
seen in this chapter. All of them can be easily extended to 2D. There
are more variations of the Fourier transform that we will not discuss
here.

## Fourier Analysis as an Image Representation

The Fourier transform has been extensively used as an image
representation. In this section we will discuss the information about
the picture that is made explicit by this representation.

As we discussed before, the Fourier transform of an image can be written
in polar form:
$$\mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]  = A \left[u,v \right] \, \exp{\left( j\, \theta\left[u,v \right]  \right)}$$
where
$A \left[u,v \right] = \left| \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]  \right|$ and
$\theta \left[u,v \right] = \angle  \mathscr{L}\left[u,v \right]$.



:::{.column-margin}
Decomposing the Fourier transform of a signal in its
amplitude and phase can be very useful. It has been a popular image
representation during the early days of computer vision and image
processing.
:::

 If we think in terms of the inverse of the
Fourier transform, $A \left[u,v \right]$ gives the strength of the
weight for each complex exponential and the phase
$\theta \left[u,v \right]$ translates the complex exponential. The phase
carries the information of where the image contours are by specifying
how the phases of the sinusoids must line up in order to create the
observed contours and edges. In fact, as shown in
section [1.7](#section:DFTproperties){reference-type="ref"
reference="section:DFTproperties"}, translating the image in space only
modifies the phase of its Fourier transform. In short, one can think
that location information goes into the phase while intensity scaling
goes into the magnitude.

One might ask which is more important in determining the appearance of
the image, the magnitude of the Fourier transform, or its phase.
@fig-phaseoramp shows the result of a classical experiment that
consists of computing the Fourier transform for two images and building
two new images by swapping their phases @Oppenheim1981.

![](figures/Image_processing_fourier/amp_phase_swap_color.png){width="100%"}

The first output image is the inverse Fourier transform of the amplitude
of the first input image and the phase of the DFT of the second input
image. The second output image contains the other two terms. The figure
shows that the appearance of the resulting images is mostly dominated by
the phase of the image they come from. The image built with the phase of
the stop sign looks like the stop sign even if the amplitude comes from
a different image. @fig-phaseoramp shows the result in color by doing
the same operation over each color channel (red, green, and blue)
independently. The phase signal determines where the edges and colors
are located in the resulting image. The final colors are altered as the
amplitudes have changed.



:::{.column-margin}
A remarkable property of natural images: the
magnitude of their DFT generally has its maximum at the origin and
decays inversely proportional to the radial frequency.
:::

 One
remarkable property of real images is that the magnitude of the DFT of
natural images is quite similar and can be approximated by
$A \left[u,v \right] = a/ (u^2+v^2)^b$ with $a$ and $b$ being two
constants. We will talk more about this property when discussing
statistical models of natural images in chapter
[\[chapter-stat_image_models\]](#sec-stat_image_models){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-stat_image_models"}. This typical structure of the
DFT magnitude of natural images has been used as a prior for many tasks
such as image denoising.

![](figures/Image_processing_fourier/dft_random_phaseandamplitude.png){width="100%"}

However, this does not mean that all the information of the image is
contained inside the phase only. The amplitude contains very useful
information as shown in @fig-phasevsamp. To get an intuition of the
information available on the amplitude and phase let's do the following
experiment: let's take an image, compute the Fourier transform, and
create two images by applying the inverse Fourier transform when
removing one of the components while keeping the other original
component. For the amplitude image, we will randomize the phase. For the
phase image, we will replace the amplitude by a noninformative
$A \left[u,v \right] = 1/(u^2+v^2)^{1/2}$ for all images. This amplitude
is better than a random amplitude because a random amplitude produces a
very noisy image hiding the information available, while this generic
form for the amplitude will produce a smoother image, revealing its
structure while still removing any information available on the original
amplitude. @fig-phasevsamp shows different types of images and how the
DFT amplitude and phase contribute to defining the image content. The
top image is inline with the observation from @fig-phaseoramp where
phase seems to be carrying most of the image information. However, the
rest of the images do not show the same pattern. As we move down along
the examples in the figure, the relative importance between the two
components changes. And for the bottom image (showing a pseudo-periodic
thread texture) the amplitude is the most important component.

The amplitude is great for capturing images that contain strong periodic
patterns. In such cases, the amplitude can be better than the phase.
This observation has been the basis for many image descriptors
@Gorkani94, @oliva01. The amplitude is somewhat invariant to location
(although it is not invariant to the relative location between different
elements in the scene). However the phase is a complex signal that does
not seem to make explicit any information about the image.

![](figures/Image_processing_fourier/FTgame.png){width="100%"}

Take the following quiz: match the Fourier transform magnitudes with the
corresponding images in @fig-quiz[^1]. Some image patterns are easily
visible in the Fourier domain. For instance, strong image contrasts
produce oriented lines in the Fourier domain. Periodic patterns are also
clearly visible in the Fourier domain. A periodic pattern in the image
domain produces periodic impulses in the Fourier domain. The location of
the impulses will be related to the period and orientation or the
repetitions.

## Fourier Analysis of Linear Filters {#sect:transfer_function}

Linear convolutions, despite their simplicity, are surprisingly useful
for processing and interpreting images. It's often very useful to blur
images, in preparation for subsampling or to remove noise, for example.
Other useful processing includes edge enhancement and motion analysis.
From the previous section we know that we can write linear filters as
convolutions:

::: center
=\[draw, minimum size=3em\] = \[pin edge=to-,thin,black\]
:::

where $h \left[n,m \right]$ is the impulse response of the system, or
convolution kernel. We can also write this as a product in the Fourier
domain:

::: center
=\[draw, minimum size=3em\] = \[pin edge=to-,thin,black\]
:::

The function $H \left[u, v \right]$ is called the **transfer function**
of the filter. 

:::{.column-margin}
The transfer function of a filter is
the Fourier transform of the convolution kernel.
:::

 The transfer
function will allow us interpret filters by how they modify the spectral
content of the input signal. As the Fourier transform of the output is
just a product between the Fourier transform of the input and the
transfer function, a linear filter simply reweights the spectral content
of the signal. It does not create new content, it can only enhance or
decrease the spectral components already present in the input.


:::{.column-margin}
A convolution between two signals does not create new
spectral content. To create new spectral components not present in the
input we need to apply nonlinearities.

If we use the polar form:
$$H \left[u,v \right] = \left|H \left[u, v \right] \right| \exp \left( {j \, \angle H \left[u, v \right]} \right)
$${#eq-polar-lin} The magnitude $\left| H \left[u, v \right] \right|$ is
the **amplitude gain**, and the phase $\angle H \left[u, v \right]$ is
the **phase shift**. The magnitude at the origin,
$\left| H \left[0, 0 \right] \right|$, is the **DC gain** of the filter
(the average value of the output signal is equal to the average value of
the input times the DC gain).

The Fourier domain shows that, in many cases, what a filter does is to
block or let pass certain frequencies. Filters are many times classified
according to the frequencies that they let pass through the filter (low,
medium, or high frequencies) as shown in @fig-typestypes.

When filtering images, low-pass filters will output a blurry picture
encoding the **coarse** elements of the image. A band-pass filter will
highlight middle size elements, while the output of a high-pass filter
will show the **fine** details of the image. The three images in
@fig-sketchresponses show the output image processed by three filters
corresponding to the frequency responses of @fig-typestypes.

There are many other properties of a filter that can be used to classify
linear systems (e.g., causality, stability, phase-changes). Some filters
have their main effect over the phase of the signal and they are better
understood in the spatial domain. In general, filters affect both the
magnitude and the phase of the input signal.

Let's now look at two examples of the application of the Fourier
analysis of linear filters.

### Example 1: Removing the Columns from the MIT Building

@fig-filteringFTa shows a picture of the main MIT building. The columns
produce a quasiperiodic pattern. @fig-filteringFTb shows the magnitude
of the DFT of the MIT picture. One can see picks in the horizontal
frequency axis, those picks are due to the columns.

To check this we can verify first that the location of the picks is
related to the separation of the columns. The image in
@fig-filteringFTa has a size of $256\times256$ pixels, and the columns
are repeated every 14 pixels. Therefore, the DFT, with $N=256$, will
have picks at the horizontal frequencies: $256/14=18.2$, which is indeed
what we observe in @fig-filteringFTb. As the repeated pattern is not a
pure sinusoidal function, there will be picks at all the harmonic
frequencies $k\frac{256}{14}$, where $k$ is an integer. Note also that
the picks seem to produce vertical bands with decreasing amplitude with
increasing vertical frequency $v$. These bands occur because the columns
only occupy a small vertical segment of the image. Also, as the columns
only exist in a portion of the horizontal region of the image, the picks
also have some horizontal width.

We can now also check the effect of suppressing those frequencies by
zeroing the magnitude of the DFT around each pick (here we zero 7 pixels
in the horizontal dimension and all the pixels along the vertical
dimension) as shown @fig-filteringFTd. @fig-filteringFTc shows the
resulting image where the columns are almost gone while the rest of the
image is little affected. @fig-filteringFTe shows the complementary
image (in fact, $a=c+e$) and its DFT in @fig-filteringFTf.

### Example 2: The Human Visual System and the Contrast Sensitivity Function

Before we start describing different types of linear filters in the next
chapters, let's start by gaining some subjective experience by playing
with one: our own visual system. Although our visual system is clearly a
nonlinear system, linear filter theory can explain some aspects of our
perception. Indeed, under certain conditions, the first stages of visual
computation perform of the visual system can be approximated by a linear
filter.

Fourier analysis and the use of sine waves became very popular in the
field of visual psychophysics. **Visual psychophysics** is an
experimental science that studies the relationship between real world
stimuli and our perception. 

Using the theory we have studied in this chapter, we can show that when
the input to a linear system is a wave of frequency $u_0$ and amplitude
1, the output is another wave of the same frequency as the input but
with an amplitude equal to $|H \left[ u_0 \right]|$:

This means that one way of identifying the transfer function of a system
is by using as input a wave and measuring the output amplitude as a
function of the input frequency $u_0$. This inspired a generation of
psychophysicists to study how the human visual system behaved when
presented with periodic signals.

To experience the transfer function of our own visual system, let's
build the following $N \times M$ image:
$$\ell\left[n,m\right] = A\left[m\right] \sin(2 \pi f\left[n\right] n/N)$$
with
$$A\left[m\right] = A_{min} \left(\frac{A_{max}}{A_{min}}\right)^{m/M}$$
and
$$f\left[n\right] = f_{min} \left(\frac{f_{max}}{f_{min}}\right)^{n/N}$$
This image is separable and it is composed of two factors: an amplitude,
$A\left[m\right]$, that varies only along the vertical dimension, $m$,
and a wave with a frequency, $f\left[n\right]$, that varies along the
horizontal component, $n$. The amplitude, $A\left[m\right]$, goes from
$A_{max}$ to $A_{min}$ on a logarithmic scale. The frequency function,
$f\left[n\right]$, is defined as an increasing function that starts from
$f_{min}=1$ and grows up to $f_{max}=60$ (with $N=2,048$ being the
number of horizontal pixels in the image). This image is shown in
@fig-csfchart and it is also called the **Campbell and Robson chart**.
It appears to an observer as a signal with a wave that oscillates slow
at the left and faster toward the right and that has high contrast a the
bottom and loses contrast towards the top becoming invisible.

![](figures/spatial_filters/csf.jpg){width="100%"}

The first sign that our visual system is nonlinear is that we do not
perceive the amplitude as changing exponentially fast from top to
bottom. It feels more linear. This is because our photo-receptors
compute the $\log$ of the incoming intensity (approximately).

What is interesting is that @fig-csfchart is not perceived as being
separable. If you trace the region where the sine wave seems to
disappears you will trace a curve. In fact, your visual system acts like
a band-pass filter: you are sensitive to middle spatial frequencies
(peaking around 6 cycles/degree) and less sensitive to very low spatial
frequencies (on the left of the image) and high spatial frequencies (on
the right of the image). This curve, known as the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF) in psychophysics literature, closely resembles the
magnitude of the transfer function of the filter,
$H \left[ u,v \right]$, which approximates the human visual system
@de1988spatial.

The CSF is not a simple linear function but it can be approximated by
one under certain conditions. However, the CSF changes depending of many
factors such as overall intensity (the pick moves toward the left under
low illumination.), adaptation (long exposure to one frequency reduces
the sensitivity for that frequency), age, and so on.



## Concluding Remarks

The Fourier transform is an indispensable tool for linear systems
analysis, image analysis, and for efficient filter output computation.
Among the benefits of the Fourier transform representation are that it's
easy to analyze images according to spatial frequency, and this
represents some progress in interpreting the image over merely a pixel
representation. But the Fourier transform has a major drawback as an
image representation: it's too global! Every sinusoidal component covers
the entire image. The Fourier transform tells us a little about **what**
is happening in the image (based on the spatial frequency content), but
it tells us nothing about **where** it is happening.

Conversely, a pixel representation gives great spatial localization, but
a pixel value by itself doesn't help us learn much about what's going on
in the image. A Fourier representation tells us a bit about what's going
on, but nothing about where it happens. We seek a representation that's
somewhere in between those two extremes.

In the next chapters we will analyze several important linear filters.
We will study spatial filters first, and then temporal filters. The
filters we will study provide a foundation to understand many basic
image processing operations, and to interpret learned filters by neural
networks.
