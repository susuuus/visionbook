# Linear Image Filtering {#sec-linear_image_filtering}

## Introduction

We want to build a vision system that operates in the real world. One
such system is the human visual system. Although much remains to be
understood about how our visual system processes images, we have a
fairly good idea of what happens at the initial stages of visual
processing, and it will turn out to be similar to some of the filtering
we discuss in this chapter. While we're inspired by the biology, here we
describe some mathematically simple processing that will help us to
parse an image into useful tokens, or **low-level features** that will
be useful later to construct visual interpretations.

We'd like for our processing to enhance image structures of use for
subsequent interpretation, and to remove variability within the image
that makes more difficult comparisons with previously learned visual
signals. Let's proceed by invoking the simplest mathematical processing
we can think of: a linear filter. Linear filters as computing structures
for vision have received a lot of attention because of their surprising
success in modeling some aspect of the processing carried our by early
visual areas such as the retina, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
and primary visual cortex (V1) @Hubel62. In this chapter we will see how
far it takes us toward these goals.

For a deeper understanding there are many books @Oppenheim1996 devoted
to **signal processing**, providing essential tools for any computer
vision scientist. In this chapter we will present signal processing
tools from a computer vision and image processing perspective.

## Signals and Images

A **signal** is a measurement of some physical quantity (light, sound,
height, temperature, etc.) as a function of another independent quantity
(time, space, wavelength, etc.). A **system** is a process/function that
transforms a signal into another.

### Continuous and Discrete Signals

Although most of the signals that exist in nature are infinite
**continuous signals**, when we introduce them into a computer they are
sampled and transformed into a finite sequence of numbers, also called a
**discrete signal**.

:::{.column_margin}
**Sampling** is the process of transforming a continuous signal into a discrete one and will be studied in detail in @sec-sampling.
:::

If we consider the light that reaches one camera photo sensor, we could
write it as a one dimensional function of time, $\ell(t)$, where
$\ell(t)$ denotes the incident $\ell$ight at time $t$, and $t$ is a
continuous variable that can take on any real value. The signal
$\ell(t)$ is then **sampled** in time (as is done in a video) by the
camera where the values are only captured at discrete times (e.g., 30
times per second). In that case, the signal $\ell$ will be defined only
on discrete time instants and we will write the sequence of measured
values as: $\ell\left[ n \right]$, where $n$ can only take on integer
values. The relationship between the discrete and the continuous signals
is given by the sampling equation:
$$\ell\left[n\right] = \ell\left(n~\Delta T \right)$$ where $\Delta T$is the **sampling period**. For instance, $\Delta T = 1/30$ s in the
case of sampling the signal 30 times per second. 

As is common in signal
processing, we will use parenthesis to indicate continuous variables and
brackets to denote discrete variables. For instance, if we sample the
signal shown in @fig-contdiscsignal (a) once every second
($\Delta T = 1$ s) we get the discrete signal shown in
@fig-contdiscsignal (b).


![Fig (a) A continuous signal, and (b) a discrete signal obtained by sampling the continuous signal at the times $t=n$.](figures/linear_image_filtering/contdiscsignal.png)
{#fig-contdiscsignal}

The signal in @fig-contdiscsignal (b) is a function that takes on the
values $\ell\left[0\right] = 3$, $\ell\left[1\right] = 2$,
$\ell\left[2\right] = 1$ and $\ell\left[3\right] = 4$ and all other
values are zero, $\ell\left[n\right] = 0$. In most of the book we will
work with discrete signals. In many cases it will be convenient to write
discrete signals as vectors. Using vector notation we will write the
previous signal, in the interval $n \in \left[0,6 \right],$ as a column
vector $\boldsymbol\ell= \left[3, 2, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0\right]^T$, where $T$
denotes transpose.

### Images

An image is a two dimensional array of values:
$\boldsymbol\ell\in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$, where $N$ is the image
width and $M$ is the image height. A grayscale image is then just an
array of numbers such as the following (in this example, intensity
values are scaled between 0 and 256): 

$$\begin{array}{cc}
\boldsymbol\ell= & 
\left[
\begin{smallmatrix} 160 & 175 & 171 & 168 & 168 & 172 & 164 & 158 & 167 & 173 & 167 & 163 & 162 & 164 & 160 & 159 & 163 & 162\\ 149 & 164 & 172 & 175 & 178 & 179 & 176 & 118 & 97 & 168 & 175 & 171 & 169 & 175 & 176 & 177 & 165 & 152\\ 161 & 166 & 182 & 171 & 170 & 177 & 175 & 116 & 109 & 169 & 177 & 173 & 168 & 175 & 175 & 159 & 153 & 123\\ 171 & 174 & 177 & 175 & 167 & 161 & 157 & 138 & 103 & 112 & 157 & 164 & 159 & 160 & 165 & 169 & 148 & 144\\ 163 & 163 & 162 & 165 & 167 & 164 & 178 & 167 & 77 & 55 & 134 & 170 & 167 & 162 & 164 & 175 & 168 & 160\\ 173 & 164 & 158 & 165 & 180 & 180 & 150 & 89 & 61 & 34 & 137 & 186 & 186 & 182 & 175 & 165 & 160 & 164\\ 152 & 155 & 146 & 147 & 169 & 180 & 163 & 51 & 24 & 32 & 119 & 163 & 175 & 182 & 181 & 162 & 148 & 153\\ 134 & 135 & 147 & 149 & 150 & 147 & 148 & 62 & 36 & 46 & 114 & 157 & 163 & 167 & 169 & 163 & 146 & 147\\ 135 & 132 & 131 & 125 & 115 & 129 & 132 & 74 & 54 & 41 & 104 & 156 & 152 & 156 & 164 & 156 & 141 & 144\\ 151 & 155 & 151 & 145 & 144 & 149 & 143 & 71 & 31 & 29 & 129 & 164 & 157 & 155 & 159 & 158 & 156 & 148\\ 172 & 174 & 178 & 177 & 177 & 181 & 174 & 54 & 21 & 29 & 136 & 190 & 180 & 179 & 176 & 184 & 187 & 182\\ 177 & 178 & 176 & 173 & 174 & 180 & 150 & 27 & 101 & 94 & 74 & 189 & 188 & 186 & 183 & 186 & 188 & 187\\ 160 & 160 & 163 & 163 & 161 & 167 & 100 & 45 & 169 & 166 & 59 & 136 & 184 & 176 & 175 & 177 & 185 & 186\\ 147 & 150 & 153 & 155 & 160 & 155 & 56 & 111 & 182 & 180 & 104 & 84 & 168 & 172 & 171 & 164 & 168 & 167\\ 184 & 182 & 178 & 175 & 179 & 133 & 86 & 191 & 201 & 204 & 191 & 79 & 172 & 220 & 217 & 205 & 209 & 200\\ 184 & 187 & 192 & 182 & 124 & 32 & 109 & 168 & 171 & 167 & 163 & 51 & 105 & 203 & 209 & 203 & 210 & 205\\ 191 & 198 & 203 & 197 & 175 & 149 & 169 & 189 & 190 & 173 & 160 & 145 & 156 & 202 & 199 & 201 & 205 & 202\\ 153 & 149 & 153 & 155 & 173 & 182 & 179 & 177 & 182 & 177 & 182 & 185 & 179 & 177 & 167 & 176 & 182 & 180 \end{smallmatrix}\right]
\end{array}$$

This matrix represents an image of size $18 \times 18$ pixels as encoded
in a computer. Can you guess what object appears in the array? The goal
of a computer vision system is to **reorganize** this array of numbers
into a meaningful representation of the scene depicted in the image. The
next image shows the same array of values but visualized as gray levels.

![Grayscale image showing a person walking in the street. This tiny image has only $18\times18$ pixels.](figures/linear_image_filtering/gray_image.png){width="100%"}


When we want to make explicit the location of a pixel we will write
$\ell\left[n, m \right]$, where $n \in \left[0,N-1 \right]$ and
$m \in \left[0,M-1 \right]$ are the indices for the horizontal and
vertical dimensions, respectively. Each value in the array indicates the
intensity of the image in that location. For color images we will have
three channels, one for each color.

Although images are discrete signals, in some cases it is useful to work
on the continuous domain as it simplifies the derivation of analytical
solutions. This was the case in the previous chapter where we used the
image gradient in the continuous domain and then approximated it in the
discrete space domain. In those cases we will write images as
$\ell(x,y)$ and video sequences as $\ell(x,y,t)$.

### Properties of a Signal

Here are some important quantities that are useful to characterize
signals. As most signals represent physical quantities, a lot of the
terminology used to describe them is borrowed from physics.

Both continuous and discrete signals can be classified according to its
extend. **Infinite length** signals are signals that extend over the
entire support $\ell\left[n \right]$ for $n \in (-\infty, \infty)$.
**Finite length** signals have non-zero values on a compact time
interval and they are zero outside, i.e. $\ell\left[n \right] = 0$ for
$n \notin S$ where $S$ is a finite length interval. A signal
$\ell\left[n \right]$ is **periodic** if there is a value $N$ such that
$\ell\left[n \right] = \ell\left[n + k N\right]$ for all $n$ and $k$. A
periodic signal is an infinite length signal. An important quantity is
the mean value of a signal often called the **DC value**.  In
the case of an image, the DC component is the average intensity of the
image. For a finite signal of length $N$ (or a periodic signal), the
**DC value** is
$$\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ell\left[n\right]$$ If the signal
is infinite, the average value is
$$\mu = \lim_{N \xrightarrow{} \infty} \frac{1}{2N+1} \sum_{n=-N}^{N} \ell\left[n\right]$$

Another important quantity to characterize a signal is its energy.
Following the same analogy with physics, the **energy of a signal** is
defined as the sum of squared magnitude values:
$$E = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} \left| \ell\left[n\right] \right| ^2$$


:::{.column_margin}
Siganl energy and general energy are equivalent up to a normalization constant. For instance, the energy dissipated by a resistance $R$ with voltage $v(t)$ is
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{R} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v(t) ^2 dt
\end{equation}
:::

Signal are further classified as **finite energy** and **infinite
energy** signals. Finite length signals are finite energy and periodic
signals are infinite energy signals when measuring the energy in the
whole time axis.

If we want to compare two signals, we can use the squared Euclidean
distance (squared L2 norm) between them:
$$D^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \left| \ell_1 \left[n\right] - \ell_2 \left[n\right] \right| ^2$$
However, the euclidean distance (L2) is a poor metric when we are
interested in comparing the content of the two images and the building
better metrics is an important area of research. Sometimes, the metric
is L2 but in a different representation space than pixel values. We will
talk about this more later in the book.

The same definitions apply also to continuous signals, where all the
equations are analogous by replacing the sums with integrals. For
instance, in the case of the energy of a continuous signal, we can write
$E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left| \ell\left( t \right) \right|^2 dt$,
which assumes that the integral is finite. Most natural signals will
have infinite energy.

## Systems

The kind of systems that we will study here take a signal,
$\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}$, as input, perform some computation,
$f$, and output another signal,
$\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{out}}= f(\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}})$.


![System processing one signal.](figures/linear_image_filtering/genericfilterH.png){#fig-genericfilterH}

This transformation is very general and it can do all sorts of complex
things: it could detect edges in images, recognize objects, detect
motion in sequences, or apply aesthetic transformations to a picture.
The function $f$ could be specified as a mathematical operation or as an
algorithm. As a consequence, it is very difficult to find a simple way
of characterizing what the function $f$ does. In the next section we
will study a simple class of functions $f$ that allow for a simple
analytical characterization: linear systems.

### Linear Systems

**Linear systems** represent a very small portion of all the possible
systems one could implement, but we will see that they are capable of
creating very interesting image transformations. A function $f$ is
linear is it satisfies the following two properties:

$$\begin{aligned}
f\left( \boldsymbol\ell_1+\boldsymbol\ell_2 \right) &=& f(\boldsymbol\ell_1)+ f(\boldsymbol\ell_2) \\ \nonumber
f(a\boldsymbol\ell) &=& af(\boldsymbol\ell) ~~\text{~for any scalar~} a
\end{aligned}$$

Although the previous properties might seem simple, it is easy to get
confused on when an operation can be or not represented by a linear
function. Let's first check your intuition about what operations are
linear and which ones are not. Which ones of the image transformations
shown in @fig-transformationsquizz can be written as linear systems?
[^1]

![{Which one of these four image transformations (rotation by 30 degrees, scaling by 1/2, color to grayscale, and defocusing) can be written as linear functions?](figures/linear_image_filtering/whichoneislinear.png){width="100%" #fig-transformationsquizz}

To make things more concrete, lets assume the input is a 1D signal with
length $N$ that we will write as $\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n \right]$,
and the output is another 1D signal with length $M$ that we will write
as $\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n \right]$. Most of the times we will work
with input and output pairs with the same length $M=N$. A linear system,
in its most general form, can be written as follows:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n \right] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h \left[n,k\right] \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k \right] ~~~ for ~~~ n \in \left[0, M-1 \right]
$${#eq-general_lin_filter} where each output value
$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n \right]$ is a linear combination of values
of the input signal $\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n \right]$ with weights
$h \left[n,k\right]$. The value $h \left[n,k\right]$ is the weight
applied to the input sample $\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k \right]$ to
compute the output sample $\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n \right]$. To help
visualizing the operation performed by the linear filter it is useful to
write it in matrix form: $$\begin{bmatrix}\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ 0 \right] \\
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ 1 \right] \\
\vdots \\
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ n \right] \\
\vdots \\
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ M-1 \right]
\end{bmatrix}
 =
\begin{bmatrix}
  h\left[0,0\right] ~&~ h\left[0,1\right] ~&~ ... ~&~ h\left[0,N-1\right] \\
  h\left[1,0\right] ~&~ h\left[1,1\right] ~&~ ... ~&~ h\left[1,N-1\right] \\
  \vdots ~&~  \vdots ~&~  \vdots ~&~  \vdots \\
  \vdots ~&~  \vdots ~&~  h \left[n,k\right] ~&~  \vdots \\
\vdots ~&~  \vdots ~&~  \vdots ~&~  \vdots \\
  h\left[M-1,0\right] ~&~ h\left[M-1,1\right] ~&~ ... ~&~ h\left[M-1,N-1\right] 
 \end{bmatrix}
~
 \begin{bmatrix}
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[0\right] \\
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[1\right] \\
  \vdots \\
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k\right] \\
  \vdots \\
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[N-1\right]
 \end{bmatrix}$$ which we will write in short form as
$\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{out}}=  \mathbf{H} \boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}$.
The matrix $\mathbf{H}$ has size $M \times N$. We will use the matrix
formulation many times in this book.

A linear function can also be drawn as a **fully connected layer** in a
neural network, with weights $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{H}$, where the output
unit $i$, $\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[i \right]$, is a linear combination
of the input signal $\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}$ with weights given
by the row vectors of $\mathbf{H}$. Graphically it looks like this:

![A linear function drawn as a {\bf fully connected layer} in a neural network.](figures/linear_image_filtering/linear_filter.png){width=".4" #fig-linear_filter}

In two dimensions the equations are analogous. Each pixel of the output
image, $\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m\right]$, is computed as a linear
combination of pixels of the input image,
$\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n, m\right]$:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m \right] = \sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \sum_{l=0}^{N-1} h \left[n,m,k,l \right] \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k,l \right]
$${#eq-lin} By writing the images as column vectors, concatenating all the
image columns into a long vector, we can also write the previous
equation using matrices and vectors:
$\boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{out}}=  \mathbf{H} \boldsymbol\ell_{\texttt{in}}$.

### Linear Translation Invariant Systems

Linear systems are still too general for us. So let's consider an even
smaller family of systems: **linear translation invariant** (LTI)
**systems**.

![](figures/linear_image_filtering/space_of_functions.png){width=".25"}

Translation invariant systems are motivated by the following
observation: typically, we don't know where within the image we expect
to find any given item (@fig-translationInvar), so we often want to
process the image in a spatially invariant manner, the same processing
algorithm at every pixel.

![A fundamental property of images is translation
  invariance--the same image may appear at arbitrary spatial positions
  within the image. {\em Source}: Fredo Durand.](figures/linear_image_filtering/fredo_birds1.jpg){width="100%" #fig-translationInvar}

An example of a translation invariant system is a function that takes as
input an image and computes at each location a local average value of
the pixels around in a window of $5 \times 5$ pixels:

$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m \right] = \frac{1}{25} \sum_{k=-2}^{2} \sum_{l=-2}^{2} \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n+k,m+l \right]$$

A system is an LTI system if it is linear and when we translate the
input signal by $n_0, m_0$, then output is also translated by
$n_0, m_0$:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ n - n_0, m-m_0 \right] = f \left( \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[ n-n_0, m-m_0 \right] \right)$$
for any $n_0,m_0$. This property is called **equivariant** with respect
to translation. Translation invariance and linearity impose a strong
constraint on the form of equation (@eq-general_lin_filter).

In that case, the linear system becomes a **convolution** of the image
data with some **convolution kernel**. This operation is very important
and we devote the rest of this chapter to study its properties.

## Convolution

The convolution, denoted $\circ$, between a signal
$\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n \right]$ and the **convolutional kernel**
$h\left[n \right]$ is defined as follows:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n\right] = h \left[n\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right] =  \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} h \left[n-k \right] \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k \right]
$${#eq-1dconv} 

The convolution computes the output values as a linear
weighted sum. The weight between the input sample
$\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k \right]$ and the output sample
$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n\right]$ is a function $h\left[n, k \right]$
that depends only on their relative position $n-k$. Therefore,
$h\left[n, k \right]=h\left[n-k \right]$. If the signal
$\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n \right]$ has a finite length, $N$, then the
sum is only done in the interval $k \in \left[0,N-1\right]$.

The convolution is related to the **correlation** operator. In the
correlation, the weights are defined as
$h\left[n, k \right]=h\left[k-n \right]$. The convolution and the
correlation use the same kernel but mirrored around the origin. The
correlation is also translation invariant as we will discuss at the end
of the chapter.

:::{.column-margin}
Most of the literature in neural networks calls
convolution to the correlation operator. As the kernels are learned, the
distinction is not important most of the time.
:::

One important property of the convolution is that it is commutative:
$h\left[n\right] \circ \ell\left[n\right] = \ell\left[n\right] \circ h\left[n\right]$.
This property is easy to prove by changing the variables, $k = n - k'$,
so that: 

$$h \left[n\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right] =\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} h \left[n-k \right] \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k \right] = \sum_{k'=-\infty}^{\infty} h \left[k' \right] \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n-k' \right]  = 
\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right] \circ h \left[n\right]$$

The convolution operation can be described in words as: first take the
kernel $h\left[k\right]$ and mirror it $h\left[-k \right]$, then shift
the mirrored kernel so that the origin is at location $n$, then multiply
the input values around location $n$ by the mirrored kernel and sum the
result. Store the result in the output vector
$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n\right]$. For instance, if the convolutional
kernel has three non-zero values: $h\left[-1 \right] =1$,
$h\left[0 \right] = 2$ and $h\left[1 \right] = 3$, then the output value
at location $n$ is
$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n\right] = 3 \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n-1\right]+2 \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right] + 1 \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n+1\right]$.
For finite length signals, it helps to make explicit the structure of
the convolution writing it in matrix form. For instance, if the
convolutional kernel has only three non-zero values, then:
$$\begin{bmatrix}
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ 0 \right] \\
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ 1 \right] \\
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ 2 \right] \\
\vdots \\
\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[ N-1 \right]
\end{bmatrix}
 =
\begin{bmatrix}
  h\left[0\right] ~&~ h\left[-1\right] ~&~ 0 ~&~ ... ~&~ 0 \\
  h\left[1\right] ~&~ h\left[0\right] ~&~ h\left[-1\right] ~&~... ~&~ 0 \\
  0 ~&~ h\left[1\right] ~&~ h\left[0\right] ~&~... ~&~ 0 \\
  \vdots ~&~  \vdots ~&~  \vdots ~&~  \vdots \\
  0 ~&~ 0 ~&~ 0 ~&~... ~&~ h\left[0\right] 
 \end{bmatrix}
~
 \begin{bmatrix}
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[0\right] \\
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[1\right] \\
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[2\right] \\
  \vdots \\
  \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[N-1\right]
 \end{bmatrix}$$

This operation is much easier to understand if we draw it as a
**convolutional layer** of a neural network as shown in @fig-conv_filter2_nn.

![ convolution represented as a layer in a neural network. Each output unit $i$, $\imgout \left[i \right]$, is a linear combination of the input signal values around location $i$ always using the same set of weights given by $\mathbf{h}$.](figures/linear_image_filtering/conv_filter2.png){width="50%" #fig-conv_filter2_nn}

In two dimensions, the processing is analogous: the input filter is
flipped vertically and horizontally, then slid over the image to record
the inner product with the image everywhere. Mathematically, this is:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m\right] = h \left[n,m\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n,m\right] =  \sum_{k,l}h \left[n-k,m-l \right] \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k,l \right]
$${#eq-2dconv} 

The next figure shows the result of a 2D convolution
between a $3 \times 3$ kernel with a $9 \times 9$ image. The particular
kernel used in the figure averages in the vertical direction and takes
differences horizontally. The output image reflects that processing,
with horizontal differences accentuated and vertical changes diminished.
To compute one of the pixels in the output image, we start with an input
image patch of $3 \times 3$ pixels, we flip the convolutional kernel
upside-down and left-right, and then we multiply all the pixels in the
image patch with the corresponding flipped kernel values and we sum the
results.

![Illustration of a 2D convolution of an input image with a kernel of size $3 \times 3$.For the pixels in the boundary we assumed that input image has zero values outside its boundary. The red and green boxes show the input pixels used to compute the corresponding output pixels.](figures/linear_image_filtering/circle_conv_example.png){width="100%" #fig-circle_2dconv}

Let's revisit the four image transformation examples from
@fig-transformationsquizz and ask a new question. Which ones of the
image transformations shown in @fig-transformationsquizz can be written
as a convolution? [^2]

As shown in @fig-transformationsquizz2 (a), in the defocusing
transformation each output pixel at location $n,m$ is the local average
of the input pixels in a local neighborhood around location $n,m$, and
this operation is the same regardless of what pixel output we are
computing. Therefore, it can be written as a convolution. The rotation
transformation (for a fix rotation) is a linear operation but it is not
translation invariant. As illustrated in @fig-transformationsquizz2 (b),
different output pixels require looking at input pixels in a way that is
location specific. At the top left corner, one wants to grab a pixel
from, say, five pixels up and to the right, and from the bottom right
one needs to grab the pixel from about five pixels down and to the left.
So this rotation operation can't be written as a spatially invariant
operation.

### Properties of the Convolution {#sec-linear_image_filtering:properties_of_the_convolution}

The convolution is a linear operation that will be extensively used
thorough the book and it is important to be familiar with some of its
properties.

-   **Commutative**. As we have already discussed before the convolution
    is commutative,
    $$h\left[n\right] \circ \ell\left[n\right] = \ell\left[n\right] \circ h\left[n\right]$$    which means that the order of convolutions is irrelevant. This is
    not true for the correlation.

-   **Associative**. Convolutions can be applied in any order:
    $$\ell_1 \left[n\right] \circ \ell_2 \left[n\right] \circ \ell_3 \left[n\right] = \ell_1\left[n\right] \circ (\ell_2\left[n\right] \circ \ell_3\left[n\right]) = (\ell_1\left[n\right] \circ \ell_2\left[n\right]) \circ \ell_3\left[n\right] :conv_associative_property$${#eq-linear_image_filtering}
    In practice, for finite length signals, the associative property
    might be affected by how boundary conditions are implemented.

-   **Distributive** with respect to the sum:
    $$\ell_1\left[n\right] \circ (\ell_2\left[n\right] + \ell_3\left[n\right] ) = \ell_1\left[n\right] \circ \ell_2\left[n\right] +  \ell_1 \left[n\right] \circ \ell_3 \left[n\right]$$

-   **Shift**. Another interesting property involves shifting the two
    convolved functions. Let's consider the convolution
    $\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n\right] = h\left[n\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right]$.
    If the input signal, $\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right]$, is
    translated by a constant $n_0$, i.e.
    $\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n - n_0\right]$, the result of the
    convolution with the same kernel, $h\left[n\right]$, is the same
    output as before but translated by the same constant $n_0$:
    $$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n-n_0\right] =  h\left[n\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n-n_0\right]$$
    Translating the kernel is equivalent:
    $$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n-n_0\right] =  h\left[n\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n-n_0\right]  = h\left[n-n_0\right] \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right]$$
    

-   **Support**. The convolution of a discrete signal of length $N$ with
    another discrete signal of length $M$ results in a discrete signal
    with length $L \leq M+N-1$.

-   **Identity**. The convolution also has an identity function, that is
    the **impulse**, $\delta \left[n\right]$, which takes the value 1
    for $n=0$ and it is zero everywhere else: $$\delta \left[n\right] =
      \begin{cases}
        1       & \quad \text{if } n=0\\
        0       & \quad \text{if } n \neq 0 \\
      \end{cases}$$  The convolution of the impulse with any
    other signal, $\ell\left[n\right]$, returns the same signal:
    $$\delta \left[n\right] \circ \ell\left[n\right] = \ell\left[n\right]$$

### Some Examples

@fig-convExamps shows several simple convolution examples (each color
channel is convolved with the same kernel). @fig-convExampsa shows a
kernel with a single central non-zero element,
$\delta \left[n,m\right]$, convolved with any image, gives back that
same image. @fig-convExampsb shows a kernel,
$\delta \left[n,m-2\right]$, that produces a two pixel shift toward the
right of the input image. The black line that appears on the left is due
to the zero-boundary conditions (to be discussed in the next section)
and it has a width of two pixels. @fig-convExampsc shows the result of
convolving the image with a kernel
$0.5 \delta \left[n-2,m-2\right]+ 0.5 \delta \left[n+2,m+2\right]$. This
results in two superimposed copies of the same image shifted diagonally
in opposite directions. And finally, @fig-convExampsd shows the result
of convolving the image with a uniform kernel of all $1/25$.

![Fig a) An impulse convolved with the input image gives no
 change.  (b) A shifted impulse shifts the image.  (c) Sum of two shifted copies of the image.  (d) Image defocusing by computing a local average over windows of $5 \times 5$ pixels. All the examples use zero padding for handling boundary conditions.](figures/linear_image_filtering/examples_cube2.png){width="100%" #fig-convExamps}

### Handling Boundaries

When implementing a convolution, one is confronted with the question of
what to do at the image boundaries. There's really no satisfactory
answer for how to handle the boundaries that works well for all
applications. One solution consists in omitting from the output any
pixels that are affected by the input boundary. The issue with this is
that the output will have a different size than the input and, for large
convolutional kernels, there might be a large portion of the output
image missing.


:::{.column-margin}
Only the green region contains values that can be computed, the rest will be affected by how we decide to handle the boundaries:
![](figures/linear_image_filtering/regions_convolution.png)
:::

The most general approach consists in extending the input image by
adding additional pixels so that the output can have the same size as
the input. So, for a kernel with support
$\left[ -N, N \right] \times \left[-M, M\right]$, one has to add $N/2$
additional pixels left and right of the image and $M/2$ pixels at the
top and bottom. Then, the output will have the same size as the original
input image.

Some typical choices for how to pad the input image are (see
@fig-boundaries):

-   Zero padding: Set the pixels outside the boundary to zero (or to
    some other constant such as the mean image value). This is the
    default option in most neural networks.

-   Circular padding: Extend the image by replicating the pixels from
    the other side. If the image has size $P \times Q$, circular padding
    consists of the following:
    $$\ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n,m\right] = \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[(n)_P,(m)_Q\right]$$
    where $(n)_P$ denotes the modulo operation and $(n)_P$ is the
    reminder of $n/P$.

    This padding transform the finite length signal into a periodic
    infinite length signal. Although this will introduce many artifacts,
    it is a convenient extension for analytical derivations.

-   Mirror padding: Reflect the valid image pixels over the boundary of
    valid output pixels. This is the most common approach and the one
    that gives the best results.

-   Repeat padding: Set the value to that of the nearest output image
    pixel with valid mask inputs.

@fig-boundaries shows different examples of boundary extensions.
Boundary extensions are different ways of approximating the ground truth
image that exists beyond the image boundary. The top row shows how the
image is extended beyond its boundary when using different types of
boundary extensions (only the central part corresponds to the input).
The middle row shows the output of the convolution (cropped to match the
size of the input image). We can see that the zero-padding makes a
darkening appear on the boundary of the image. This is not very
desirable in general. The other padding methods seem to produce better
visual results.

![Each row shows: (a) Different types of boundary extension. The last image shows the ground truth. (b) The output of convolving the image with a uniform kernel of size $11 \times 11$ with all the values equal to $1/121$. The output only shows the central region that corresponds to the input image without boundary extension. (c) The difference between each output and the ground truth output; see last column of (b). Note that the ground truth will not be available in practice.](figures/linear_image_filtering/boundary.png){#fig-boundaries width="100%"}

But which one is the best boundary extension? Ideally, we would to get a
result that is a close as possible to the output we would get if we had
access to a larger image. In this case we know what the larger image
looks like as shown in the last column of @fig-boundaries. For each
boundary extension method, the final row shows the absolute value of the
difference between the convolution output and the result obtained with
the ground truth.

For the example of @fig-boundaries, the error seems to be smaller when
extending the image using mirror padding. On the other extreme, zero
padding seems to be the worst.

### Circular Convolution

When convolving a finite length signal with a kernel, we have seen that
it can be convenient to extend the signal beyond its boundary to reduce
boundary artifacts. This trick is also very useful analytically and
conduces to a special case of the convolution: the **circular
convolution** uses circular padding. The circular convolution of two
signals, $h$ and $\ell_{\texttt{in}}$, of length $N$ is defined as
follows:

$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n\right] = h \left[n\right] \circ_N \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n\right] =  \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h \left[(n-k)_N \right] \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[k \right]$$

In this formulation, the signal $h \left[ (n)_N \right]$ is the infinite
periodic extension, with period $N$, of the finite length signal
$h \left[n \right]$. The output of the circular convolution is a
periodic signal with period $N$,
$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n \right] = \ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[(n)_N \right]$.

The circular convolution has the same properties than the convolution
(e.g., is commutative.)

:::{.column-margin}
Writing the circular convolution in matrix form will look like:
![](figures/linear_image_filtering/circ_conv.png)
:::


### Convolution in the Continuous Domain

The convolution in the continuous domain is defined in the same way as
with discrete signals but replacing the sums by integrals. Given two
continuous signals $h(t)$ and $\ell_{\texttt{in}}(t)$, the convolution
operator is defined as follows:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}(t) = h(t) \circ \ell_{\texttt{in}}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t-\tau) \ell_{\texttt{in}}(\tau) d\tau$$

The properties of the continuous domain convolution are analogous to the
properties of the discrete convolution, with the commutative,
associative and distributive relationships still holding.

We can also define the impulse, $\delta (t)$, in the continuous domain
such that $\ell(t) \circ \delta(t) = \ell(t)$. 

The impulse is defined as
being zero everywhere but at the origin where it takes an infinitely
high value so that its integral is equal to 1:
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t) dt = 1$$ The impulse function is
also called the impulse distribution (as it is not a function in the
strict sense) or the Dirac delta function.  


:::{.column-margin}
The delta distribution is usually represented with an arrow of height 1, indicating that it has an finite value at that point, and a finite area equal to 1:
:::

The impulse has several important properties:

-   Scaling property: $\delta (at) =  \delta (t) / |a|$

-   Symmetry: $\delta (-t) = \delta (t)$

-   Sampling property: $\ell(t) \delta (t-a) = \ell(a) \delta (t-a)$
    where $a$ is a constant. From this, we have the following:
    $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ell(t) \delta (t-a) dt = \ell(a)$$

-   As in the discrete case, the continuous impulse is also the identity
    for the convolution: $\ell(t) \circ \delta (t) = \ell(t)$.

The impulse will be useful in analytical derivations and we will see it
again in chapter @sec-sampling when we discuss sampling.

## Cross-Correlation Versus Convolution

Another form of writing a translation invariant filter is using the
cross-correlation operator. The cross-correlation provides a simple
technique to locate a template in an image. The cross-correlation and
the convolution are closely related.

The **cross-correlation** operator (denoted by $\star$) between the
image $\ell_{\texttt{in}}$ and the kernel $h$ is written as follows:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m\right] = \ell_{\texttt{in}}\star h =  \sum_{k,l=-N}^N \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n+k,m+l \right] h \left[k,l \right]$$
where the sum is done over the support of the filter $h$, which we
assume is a square $(-N,N)\times(-N,N)$. In the convolution, the kernel
is inverted left-right and up-down, while in the cross-correlation is
not. Remember that the convolution between image $\ell_{\texttt{in}}$
and kernel $h$ is written as follows:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m\right] = \ell_{\texttt{in}}\circ h = \sum_{k,l=-N}^N \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n-k,m-l \right] h \left[k,l \right]$$

@fig-corrvsconv illustrates the difference between the correlation and
the convolution. In these examples, the kernel $h[n,m]$ is a triangle
pointing up (the center of the triangle is $n=0$ and $m=0$) as shown in
@fig-corrvsconva. When the input image is black (all zeros) with only
four bright pixels, @fig-corrvsconvb, this is the convolution of the
triangle with four impulses, which results in four triangles pointing up
(@fig-corrvsconv\[c\]). However, the cross-correlation looks different;
it still results in four copies of the triangles centered on each point,
but the triangles are pointing downward (@fig-corrvsconv\[d\]).

For the input image containing triangles pointing up and down,
@fig-corrvsconve, the convolution will have its maximum output on the
triangles points down, @fig-corrvsconvf, while the correlation will
output the maximum values in the center of the triangles pointing up
(@fig-corrvsconv\[g\]).

![Cross-correlation versus convolution. (a) Kernel. (b) and (e) are two input images. (c) and (f) are the output convolution with the kernel (a). (d) and (g) are the cross-correlation output with the kernel (a).](figures/linear_image_filtering/correlation_vs_convolution.png){width="100%" #fig-corrvsconv}

Another important difference between the two operators is that the
convolution is commutative and associative while the correlation is not.
The correlation breaks the symmetry between the two functions $h$ and
$\ell_{\texttt{in}}$. For instance, in the correlation, shifting $h$ is
not equivalent to shifting $\ell_{\texttt{in}}$ (the output will move in
opposite directions). Note that the cross-correlation and convolution
outputs are identical when the kernel $h$ has central symmetry.

### Template Matching and Normalized Correlation

The goal of template matching is to find a small image patch within a
larger image. @fig-normcorr shows how to use template matching to
detect all the occurrences of the letter "a" with an image of text,
shown in @fig-normcorrb. @fig-normcorra shows the template of the
letter "a".

![Fig (a) Template. (b) Input image. (c) Correlation between input (b) and template (a). (d) Normalized correlation. e) Locations with cross-correlation above 75 percent of its maximum value.](figures/linear_image_filtering/normcorr.png){width="100%" #fig-normcorr}

Cross-correlation is a potential method for template matching, but it
has certain flaws. Consider matching the "a" template in @fig-normcorr (a)
in a given input image. Just by increasing the brightness of the image
in different parts we can increase the filter response since correlation
is essentially a multiplication between the kernel $h$ and any input
image patch $p$ (note that all the values are positive in $p$ and $h$).
In bright image regions we will have the maximum correlation values
regardless of regions' content as shown in @fig-normcorr (c).

The normalized cross-correlation, at location $(n,m)$, is the dot
product between a template, $h$, (normalized to be zero mean and unit
norm) and the local image patch, $p$, centered at that location and with
the same size as the kernel, normalized to be unit norm. This can be
implemented with the following steps: First, we normalize the kernel
$h$. The normalized kernel $\hat h$ is the result of making the kernel
$h$ zero mean and unit norm. Then, the normalized cross-correlation is
as follows (@fig-normcorr (d)): 

$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}\left[n,m\right] 
                = 
                \frac{1}{\sigma \left[n,m \right]}
                \sum_{k,l=-N}^N
                \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n+k,m+l \right]
                \hat{h} \left[k,l \right]$$ 
                
Note that this equation is similar to the correlation function, but the output is scaled by the local standard deviation, $\sigma \left[m,n \right]$, of the image patch
centered in $(n,m)$ and with support $(-N,N)\times(-N,N)$, where
$(-N,N)\times(-N,N)$ is the size of the kernel $h$. To compute the local
standard deviation, we first compute the local mean,
$\mu \left[n,m \right]$, as follows:
$$\mu \left[n,m \right] = \frac{1}{(2N+1)^2} \sum_{k,l=-N}^N \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n+k,m+l \right]$$
And then we compute:
$$\sigma^2 \left[n,m \right] = \frac{1}{(2N+1)^2} \sum_{k,l=-N}^N \left( \ell_{\texttt{in}}\left[n+k,m+l \right] - \mu \left[n,m \right] \right) ^2$$

@fig-normcorr (e) shows the detected copies of the template
@fig-normcorr (a) in the image @fig-normcorr (b). The red bounding boxes in
@fig-normcorr (e) correspond to the location with local maximum values of
the normalized cross-correlation (@fig-normcorr (d) that are above a
threshold chosen by hand.

In the example of @fig-normcorr, all the instances of the letter 'a'
have been correctly detected. But this method is very fragile when used
to detect objects and is useful only under very limited conditions.
Normalized correlation will detect the object independently of location,
but it will not be robust to any other changes such as rotation,
scaling, and changes in appearance. Just changing the font of the
letters will certainly make the approach fail.

## System Identification

One important task that we will study is that of explaining the behavior
of complex systems such as neural networks. For an LTI filter with
kernel $h\left[n\right]$, the output from an impulse is
$y\left[n\right] = h\left[n\right]$. The output of a translated impulse
$\delta \left[n -n_0 \right]$ is $h \left[n -n_0 \right]$. This is why
the kernel that defines an LTI system, $h\left[n\right]$, is also called
the impulse response of the system.



![LTI system with impulse response $h\left[n\right]$.](figures/linear_image_filtering/genericfilterH.png){width="100%" #fig:genericfilterH}

For an unknown system, one way of finding the convolution kernel $h$
consists in computing the output of the system when the input is an
impulse.

Let's start with a beautiful example from acoustics @TraerE7856. When
you are in a room you often hear that sounds are distorted with echos
(@fig-impulse_response_room_a). The number and strength of the echos
depend on the geometry of the room, whether it is full or empty and the
materials in the walls and ceilings.

![As shown in the sketch, sounds produced by one speaking person reach a listener via multiple paths. What the person hears is the superposition of all those signals. Figure modified from @TraerE7856.](figures/linear_image_filtering/impulse_response_room_a1.png){width=".6" #fig-impulse_response_room_a}


Interestingly the relationship between the sounds that are originated in
one location and what a listener hears in another position are related
by an LTI system. If you are in a room and you clap (which is a good
approximation to an impulse of sound), the echoes that you hear are very
close to the impulse response of the system formed by the acoustics of
the room. Any sounds that originates at the location of your clap will
produce a sound in the room that will be qualitatively similar to the
convolution of the acoustic signal with the echoes that you hear before
when you clapped. @fig-impulse_response_room_a2 shows a recording made
in a restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

![Fig (a) Apparatus used to measure the impulse response generated by a battery-powered speaker and a portable digital recorder. (b) Recorded acoustic impulse response of a room. Figure modified from @TraerE7856.](figures/linear_image_filtering/impulse_response_room_a2.png){width="100%" #fig-impulse_response_room_a2}  

@fig-impulse_response_room_b, adapted from @TraerE7856, shows a sketch
of how a voice signal gets distorted by the impulse response of a room
before it reaches the listener. The impulse response, $h (t)$, is
modeled here as a sequence of four impulses, the first impulse
corresponds to the direct path and the remaining three to the different
paths inside the room, modeled with different delays ($T_i$) and
amplitudes ($0 < a_i < 1$): $$h (t) = a_0 \delta (t)
+ a_1 \delta \left(t-T_1 \right) 
+ a_2 \delta \left( t-T_2 \right)
+ a_3 \delta \left( t-T_3 \right)$$ The sound that reaches the listener
is the superposition of four copies of the sound emitted by the speaker.
This can be written as the convolution of the input sound,
$\ell_{\texttt{in}}(t)$, with room impulse response, $h (t)$:
$$\ell_{\texttt{out}}(t) = \ell_{\texttt{in}}(t) \circ h(t) = a_0 \ell_{\texttt{out}}(t)
+ a_1 \ell_{\texttt{in}}(t-T_1) 
+ a_2 \ell_{\texttt{in}}(t-T_2)
+ a_3 \ell_{\texttt{in}}(t-T_3)$$ which is shown graphically in
@fig-impulse_response_room_b.

A good foundation in signal processing is a valuable background for
computer vision scientists and engineers. This short introduction should
now allow you go deeper by consulting other specialized books.

But we are not done yet. In the next chapter we will study the Fourier
transform, which will provide a useful characterization of signals and
images.
