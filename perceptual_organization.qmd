# Perceptual Grouping {#chapter-perceptual_organization}

## Introduction

The previous chapter discussed the importance of learning good visual
representations, which can serve as the substrate for further vision
algorithms. In this chapter we will continue our exploration of
perceptual representations, but we will approach it from a slightly
different school of thought, which is inherited from pre-deep learning
computer vision and from human vision science. In this tradition, one
particular kind of visual representation, the **perceptual group**,
becomes the central object of interest; we will see what these are, how
to find them, and how they are related to the representation learning
algorithms from the last chapter.

First, what is a perceptual group? Look at the photo in
@fig-perceptual_organization:perc_org_teaser and consider what you see.
Not what raw pixel values you see, but what structures you see. What are
some structures you can name?

What a camera sees is the raw RGB pixel values of the photo. But what
your mind sees is rather different. You see contours and surfaces,
objects and events.

Many of these perceptual structures can be thought of as *groups of
primitive elements*: a contour is a group of points that form a line, an
object is a group of parts that form a cohesive whole, and so on.
Because of this, understanding how humans, and machines, can identify
meaningful perceptual groups has been a longstanding area of interest in
both human and computer vision @Palmer1999.  This leads us to
a central question: which primitives should be grouped? We will examine
a few answers below, including the idea that primitives should be
grouped based on *similarity* or based on *association*. We will also
look at how natural groups can emerge as a byproduct of a downstream
purpose.

## Why Group?

Grouping is a special case of representation learning, and the reasons
to group are the same as the reasons to do representation learning:
groups are a good substrate for downstream analysis and processing. To
get an intuition for why this is, consider how you might describe the
scene around you. Go ahead and write down what you see. If you are in a
cafe, you might write, "I'm sitting at a table with my laptop in front
of me. A latte is next to the laptop; the foam and coffee are swirling
into a spiral."

Now let's look at each of these words. Some refer to objects (e.g.,
"table", "laptop", "latte"). Others refer to spatial relationships ("in
front", "next to"), and still others refer to shapes ("spiral") and
events ("swirling"). These kinds of structures---objects, relationships,
shapes, events---are the elements of perceptual organization, and you
can think of perceptual organization as being a lot like describing an
image in text. One of the hottest current trends in computer vision is
to map images to text, then use the tools of natural language processing
to reason about the image content. In this way text is treated as a
powerful image representation, and indeed it has become clear that this
kind of image representation---symbolic, discrete, semantic---can be
exceedingly
effective @alayrac2022flamingo, @wu2023visual, @gupta2023visual, @suris2023vipergpt.

Perceptual organization is all about trying to get similarly powerful
representations, but doing so via bottom-up grouping rules, rather than
by mimicking human language. In other words, perceptual organization is
about *discovering* language-like structures in the first place, from
unsupervised principles rather than from human-language supervision. Why
do we have the words we have, where did they come from? What exactly is
an *object*? This chapter may start to provide some answers.

Although the analogy to text makes clear why perceptual organization is
important, perceptual groups can also go beyond the limits of language.
Some structures we see are hard to name but still clearly represent a
coherent group in our heads. Consider, for example, the image in
@fig-perceptual_organization:perc_org_nonsemantic_example below.

There are clearly two separate objects, but we don't have names for
them. The next sections will cover a few different kinds of perceptual
groups that are important in vision.

## Segments

**Segmentation** is the problem of partitioning an image into regions
that represent different coherent entities. There is no single
definition of what is a coherent entity and it will vary depending on
the task; a segment could correspond to a nameable object, or a image
region made of a single material, or a physically distinct piece of
geometry (see
@fig-perceptual_organization:ambiguous_segmentation_example).

Segmentation can be framed as a clustering problem: assign each pixel in
an image to one of $k$ clusters. We will explore two approaches to
solving this clustering problem: (1) assign similar pixels to the same
cluster, (2) assign two pixels to the same cluster if there is no
boundary between them. We will start with the first.

### $K$-Means Segmentation

$K$-means, which we covered in chapter
[\[chapter-representation_learning\]](#chapter:representation_learning){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-representation_learning"}, is one of the simplest and
most useful clustering algorithms, so let's try it for segmentation.

$K$-means operates on a data matrix of $N$ datapoints by $M$ features
per datapoint. Our first task is to convert the segmentation problem to
that format. The simplest thing to do is let each pixel be a datapoint
and the pixel's color be its feature vector. For ease of visualization,
we will use the $ab$ color value as the two-dimensional (2D) feature per
pixel. An image represented this way can be plotted as a scatter plot
and you can think of it as samples from a distribution over $ab$ colors,
as shown in @fig-perceptual_organization:scatter_ab_fruits2.

![](./figures/perceptual_organization/scatter_ab_fruits2.png){width="75%"}

$K$-means tries to find clusters in this scatter plot (and, if you
prefer a probabilistic interpretation, it can be thought of as fitting a
mixture of Gaussians to the datapoints, which aims to approximate the
distribution from which these pixels were sampled). We can segment via
$k$-means by simply assigning each pixel to the cluster assignment of
its color value. Below we color each pixel in each cluster by the mean
color of all pixels assigned to that cluster
(@fig-perceptual_organization:kmeans_ab_fruits2).

![](./figures/perceptual_organization/kmeans_ab_fruits2.png){width="100%"}

Naturally, $k$-means on $ab$-values finds segments that correspond to
regions of roughly a constant color. This simple approach can be
surprisingly effective. notice how it segments a zebra from the
background in @fig-perceptual_organization:kmeans_ab_zebra_and_beach
(because the black and white stripes have roughly the same $ab$-values).
However, it fails to group more complex patterns that are not defined by
color similarity, as in the beach photo in
@fig-perceptual_organization:kmeans_ab_zebra_and_beach.

### Affinity-Based Segmentation {#sec-perceptual_organization:affinity_based_segmentation}

Other clustering methods are based on the idea of **affinity**, where we
try to model a distance metric (the affinity) that tells us whether two
items should be grouped. The distance metric usually measures how
similar two patterns are, or how likely they are to be part of the same
object.

For example, a simple affinity function over pixel pairs could just be
the Euclidean distance between the color values of the two pixels. There
are numerous ways we could use such an affinity to group pixels into
segments, all of which share the general idea that pixels with high
affinity should belong to the same group and pixels with low affinity
should belong to two different groups. Methods that use this idea
include those based on graph cuts @shi2000normalized, spectral
clustering @arbelaez2010contour, and Markov random field (MRF)-based
clustering (chapter
[\[chapter-probabilistic_graphical_models\]](#chapter:probabilistic_graphical_models){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-probabilistic_graphical_models"}).

We do not have time to cover all these methods and in fact they are no
longer commonly used. Instead we will focus on a method you have seen
earlier in the book that actually is in common use: contrastive learning
(which was covered in section
[\[sec-representation_learning:contrastive_learning\]](#sec:representation_learning:contrastive_learning){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-representation_learning:contrastive_learning"}).
Contrastive learning is a perfect fit for affinity-based segmentation
because contrastive methods learn from similarities (positive pairs) and
differences (negative pairs), and this is what an affinity metric gives
us! Contrastive methods learn an embedding in which datapoints with high
affinity are nearby and datapoints with low affinity are far apart. Once
we have such an embedding, clustering is easy in the embedding space,
and pretty much any off-the-shelf clustering algorithm will work; for
simplicity, we will stick with $k$-means in this
book.

:::{.column-margin}
In this book we only present one way to do
affinity-based clustering: first use affinities to supervise a embedding
in which the data is nearly clustered, then read off the clusters using
a simple quantization method like $k$-means. There are many other
affinity-based methods but this simple method often works
well.
:::



If we define affinities in terms of color distance, then there's no
point in *learning* such an embedding, because the raw colors themselves
are already a great embedding under that notion of affinity.
Affinity-based clustering only really becomes interesting when we have
nontrivial affinities to model; for example, they could be given by
human judgments about which pixels should go together in natural images.

Because human supervision is expensive and limiting, a popular
alternative is to use self-supervised affinity measures, just like we
saw in self-supervised contrastive learning. Popular contrastive
learning methods like SimCLR @chen2020simple, MoCo @he2020momentum, and
DINO @caron2021emerging, train a mapping from image patches to embedding
vectors such that two patches that come from the same image embed near
each other and patches from different images embed far apart. We can run
these methods *densely* (in a sliding window fashion) across a single
image to create a feature map of size $C \times N \times M$, where $N$
and $M$ are the spatial dimensions of the feature map and $C$ is the
dimensionality of the embedding vectors. This creates a new image where
each pixel has a value (the embedding vector) that is similar to other
pixels that the model thinks would be likely to appear in the same
scene. In effect, we have learned an affinity metric based on natural
patch co-occurrences, then used that affinity metric to obtain a feature
map that reveals the coherent regions of an image. If we apply $k$-means
to the pixels in this feature map, we can obtain an effective
segmentation. This entire pipeline is shown in
@fig-perceptual_organization:kmeans_dino, using DINO @caron2021emerging
as the particular contrastive embedding.

## Edges, Boundaries, and Contours

A complementary problem to segmentation is boundary detection, because a
partitioning of an image can be represented either by partition
assignments (segments) or by the boundaries between partitions. Many
vision algorithms organize images into different kinds of boundaries
between perceptual structures. Early vision algorithms focused on **edge
detection**, where the idea was that the edges in an image should form a
good, compact representation of the image's content, because edges are
relatively sparse, and they are stable with respect to nuisances like
noise and lighting. Subsequent work identified connections between
different kinds of edge structure and scene geometry; for example, an
edge that represents an occluding contour indicates that there is a
depth discontinuity at that location in the scene.

Chapter
[\[chapter-simplesystem\]](#chapter:simplesystem){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-simplesystem"} described some simple edge detectors
and showed their use in reconstructing scene geometry. Chapter
[\[chapter-3D_single_view\]](#chapter:3D_single_view){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-3D_single_view"} covers more recent approaches to
inferring three-dimensional (3D) scene structure, which have largely
superseded the methods that explicitly reasoned about edges.

Line drawings are another way of representing the edge structure in an
image, and they seem to be of high interest to humans. This suggests
that there may be something useful about representing images in terms of
their edge structure. Although there is an active line of research in
computer graphics on modeling line drawings, this work has not yet paid
off in vision, and it remains unclear whether or not line drawings will
one day prove as compelling to visually intelligent machines as they do
to us humans.

## Layers

If you have ever seen an early Disney cartoon (e.g., Snow White), you
may have noticed a compelling illusion of depth created by parallax
between different layers of the animated scene. 

Animators for these cartoons used a device called a multiplane camera,
which worked as follows. A camera looked at a stack of glass planes. On
each plane, the animators would draw a different **layer** of the scene.
For example, on the back plane would be the sky, then there would be
mountains on the next plane, then trees, and then the foreground
characters. During filming the planes could be shifted back and forth to
create parallax where the foreground planes move by more quickly than
the planes further back.

This device works because it is a rough approximation to the actual 3D
structure of the world. In computer vision, **layer-based**
representations like this have been popular as a way of capturing some
aspects of depth without the expense of modeling a fully 3D world;
sometimes layers and other related pseudo-3D representations are called
**2.5D representations**.

Layers are not just an approximation to true depth, but also capture
geometric structure that is *not* well-represented by depth. Consider a
pile of papers on your desk. The depth difference between one page and
the next might only be a millimeter---too small to show up on standard
depth sensing cameras. But the layer structure is obvious. Look back at
@fig-perceptual_organization:perc_org_nonsemantic_example: the depth
*order* is obvious even though you might have no idea how far apart
these objects are in metric space. Layers capture **ordinal** structure
and often this is the structure we care about; for example, if we want
to pick up a piece of paper in our pile, the main thing that matters is
if it is on top.

## Emergent Groups

It may seem like some of the topics in this chapter are out of fashion
in modern computer vision. Edge detection and bottom-up segmentation are
not the workhorses they once were. But this doesn't mean that perceptual
organization is absent from current systems. These systems still see the
world in terms of objects, contours, layers, and so forth, but those
structures are emergent in their hidden layers rather than made explicit
by human design. For example, in
@fig-representation_learning:obj_detectors_in_colorization we observed
object detectors inside a neural net trained to do colorization.

## Concluding Remarks

Perceptual organization aims to represent visual content in terms of
modular and disentangled elements that make subsequent processing
easier. In this way, perceptual organization shares the same goal as
visual representation learning, although the former deals more with
discrete structures whereas the latter has focused mostly on continuous
representations. These two fields evolved somewhat separately, with
perceptual organization having its roots in psychology and
representation learning coming more from machine learning, but these
days the end result is converging in the form of vision systems that see
the world in terms of objects, parts, relationships, layers, and many
other useful structures.
