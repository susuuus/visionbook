# Data Bias and Shift {#chapter-bias_and_shift}

## Introduction

The goal of learning is to acquire rules from past data that work well
on future data. In the theory of machine learning, it is almost always
assumed that the future is *identically distributed* as the past. In
reality, it is almost always the case that this is not true. Many of the
failures of machine learning in industry and in society are due to this
discrepancy between theory and practice.

What happens when a learned system is deployed on data that is unlike
what it was trained on? In this chapter we will look just at what can go
wrong, and in later chapters we will consider how we can mitigate these
effects.

As a case study we will look at the paper "Colorful Image
Colorization" @zhang2016colorful, which one of the authors of this book
co-authored in 2016, so we don't feel too bad pointing out its flaws. In
that paper, we trained a CNN to colorize black and white photos, and the
results looked amazing (@fig-bias_and_shift:CIC_teaser).

![](./figures/bias_and_shift/CIC_teaser_v5.jpg){width="100%"}

This was the teaser figure from our paper, showing sixteen examples of
grayscale input images and the output of our system. Looks almost
perfect, right? Well that's what people must have thought, because
shortly after releasing our code, a user of the website Reddit[^1]
turned it into a bot called ColorizeBot[^2] that would colorize black
and white photos posted on Reddit @colorizebot_blog. In
@fig-bias_and_shift:colorizebot_examples are two of the more popular
results.

![](./figures/bias_and_shift/colorizebot_examples.png){width="70%"}

The results were much worse than what we had shown in our paper. The bot
turned most photos sepia-toned, and would frequently add ugly smudges of
yellow and red. You might think, well the Reddit user must have
implemented our method incorrectly, but that isn't it; to our knowledge,
the code is correct. Why then, did it work so poorly?

The answer is data bias. We trained our colorization net on ImageNet.
Reddit users tested it on famous historical photos, extinct animals, and
old pictures of their family members. ImageNet is mostly photos of
animals, along with a few other object categories. It does not contain
many photos of scenes, and especially underrepresents humans, compared
to how often people take photos of humans. In fact, a large percent of
ImageNet photos are just dogs (around 12 percent). You can get an idea
of the degree of the bias by looking at how our net colorizes the dogs
in @fig-bias_and_shift:dogs_with_tongues.

![](./figures/bias_and_shift/dogs_with_tongues.png){width="90%"}

It adds a pinkish blob underneath their mouths! Why? Because not only is
ImageNet full of dogs, it is full of dogs with their tongues out. So the
net learned that it's a good strategy to put down a blob of pink
whenever it detects a dog mouth, regardless of whether that mouth is
open or closed.

Our net did not work well because the training data (ImageNet) was
categorically different than the test data (photos uploaded on Reddit).
This is true in terms of the content of the images but also in terms of
the photographic style of the images. ImageNet is almost exclusively
made up of photos taken with modern digital cameras. Reddit users were
more interested in old photos taken with analog cameras, full of
photographic grain and covered in dust and scratches.

## Out-of-Distribution Generalization

To formalize what's going on, we will return to a simple regression
problem, shown below (@fig-bias_and_shift:regression_example).

![](./figures/bias_and_shift/regression_example.png){width="100%"}

The green line indicates the true data generating process,
$p_{\texttt{data}}$. The training data is sampled from the flat part of
the curve, whereas the test data is sampled from a different region,
where the curve slopes sharply up. The solid black line is the least
squares fit on the training data. It is a great fit for that part of the
function but not for other parts of the data space.

The same thing is happening in the colorization example: the training
data is sampled from one part of the total data space and the test data
is sampled from another part. There is a between the training
distribution and test distribution, which we indicate with the red
arrows in @fig-bias_and_shift:colorization_domain_gap.

![](./figures/bias_and_shift/colorization_domain_gap.png){width="100%"}

Aside from colorizing photos on Reddit, how often do situations like
this come up in the real world? *All the time*. Suppose you train a
weather prediction system on data from the winter months, then test it
in the summer. Or train it in 2020 and test it in 2030. What would
happen if there were global warming? Suppose you trained a predictive
model at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the observed
behavior at that time. What happens when people adjust their behavior?
What happens if a vaccine is developed, or if a variant emerges.
Financial advisors offer a disclaimer like "past performance is no
guarantee of future results." Why do they have to say this? In classical
statistical learning theory, past performance does provide a
(probabilistic) guarantee over future results. In all these cases we are
confounded by a shifting data distribution. Shifting data is the rule,
not the exception.

## A Toy Example

Let's start by looking at toy example. In this toy example, we will
consider that we have access to two datasets, each one with different
data distributions. We will study the effect of training on one dataset
and testing on another.

Observations $(x,y)$ are sampled from a distribution where $x$ is
sampled from a Gaussian and $y$ are noisy observations of the function
$f$ applied to $x$: $$\begin{aligned}
    x &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma) \\
    y & = f(x) + \beta \epsilon \\
    \epsilon &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\end{aligned}$$ The unknown function $f$ has the form:
$$f_{\theta}(x) = \theta_0 x + \theta_1 x^2 \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{hypothesis space}$$

In the first dataset, the Gaussian parameter's are $\mu_A = -1.5$, and
the standard deviation is $\sigma_A = 1.5$. In the second dataset, the
Gaussian has $\mu_B = 2.5$ and $\sigma_B = 0.5$.

For each dataset we will sample two sets of examples. One set of
examples will be the training set, and the other set of examples will
the test set, which we will use to measure the generalization error.

Learning is done by optimizing the loss over the corresponding training
set:
$$J(\theta; \{x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\}^N_{i=1}) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i \left\lVert f_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right\rVert_2^2 + \lambda \left\lVert\theta\right\rVert_2^2 \quad\quad \triangleleft \quad\text{objective}$$

@fig-bias_and_shift:training_test_sets shows training and test examples
from both datasets and illustrates the effect of training on one dataset
and testing on another. Each plot shows the training samples (circles),
used to fit the model, and test samples (triangles) used to measure the
generalization error. The diagonal plots show the training and test set
corresponding to distribution A,
@fig-bias_and_shift:training_test_sets(top-left), and distribution B,
@fig-bias_and_shift:training_test_sets(bottom-right). In each case, the
fitted model is shown as a dashed line.

![](figures/bias_and_shift/toy_example/training_test_sets-1.png){width="100%"}

When training and testing is done using samples from the same
distribution (A to A, or B to B) the learned model (best fit) passes
near the test samples and the error is small. However, when training and
test are coming from different distributions, the error can be large.
Table
[\[table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets\]](#table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets"} shows the
generalization error made with different combinations of training and
set sets as shown in @fig-bias_and_shift:training_test_sets.

::: center
                          Test set  
  ------------------ --- ---------- --------
  3-4                A       B      
  2-4 Training set   A     $0.18$    $0.7$
  2-4                B     $1.93$    $0.23$
  2-4                               
:::

The diagonal elements correspond to the error obtained when training on
the training examples of dataset A and testing on the test examples of
dataset A, and when training and testing on dataset B.

As shown in table
[\[table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets\]](#table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets"}, the error becomes
larger for the elements off-diagonal. However, table
[\[table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets\]](#table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:bias_and_shift:training_test_sets"} only gives a
partial picture about what is happening because it gives the error only
for dataset size equal to 5. What happens if we add more data?

It is interesting in general to look at the performance as a function of
training data. If we add more data, does performance improve when
training and testing on different datasets? Or does it saturate? The
answer will depend on the form of the data distributions and the
hypothesis space. But we can check what happens in this toy example.

@fig-bias_and_shift:test_as_function_of_data plots the generalization
error (vertical axis) when evaluating on dataset A as a function of the
amount of training data (horizontal axis).

![](figures/bias_and_shift/toy_example/test_as_function_of_data-1.png){width="60%"}

Interestingly, both training sets (A and B) succeed in reducing the
generalization error on the test set of dataset A when more training
data is available. In this example, even the biased dataset B is still
able to train a successful model of dataset A. However, the reduction of
the error is slower than when training on dataset A. Examples from
dataset B are less valuable than examples from dataset A @Torralba2011.
We need approximately 10 times more examples from dataset B in order to
reach a particular performance. Another way of saying this is that the
value of a training example from dataset B when evaluating on dataset A
is around $1/10$ of the value of a sample from A.

In this toy example, we created two datasets that had a mean shift and a
standard-deviation shift. Shifts in the distributions represented by
different datasets are always present.

## Dataset Bias

The first thing is to notice that bias is present in all datasets. Even
datasets that try to cover the same aspect of the world, they collect
data with different styles and strategies that will reflect on the
statistics of the dataset. In the case of image datasets for computer
vision, the goal is to represent the visual world with all its
complexity and diversity. Despite that there is a single visual world,
different computer vision datasets offer a different, and biased, sample
of that world.

In the paper @Torralba2011, the authors propose a game that we reproduce
in @fig-bias_and_shift:datasetsJeopardy. The name of the game is *Name
That Dataset!* The figure shows three random images from 12 famous
computer vision datasets and the goal of the game is to match the images
with each dataset name. The point of the game is to show that it is easy
to recognize the *style* of images and to identify the dataset they
belong to. If the datasets were unbiased samples of the same visual
world it would be impossible to win the game, yet researchers with
experience on these datasets can get around 75 percent of the matches
right @Torralba2011.

![](figures/bias_and_shift/datasetsJeopardy-1.png){width="100%"}

 One can also train a classifier to play the *Name That
Dataset!* game automatically. We can do that by selecting a random
subset of images from each dataset that we will use to train a
classifier, and then we will test on new unseen images. Indeed, as shown
in @Torralba2011, a classifier can play the game quite successfully.

### The Value of Training Examples

In table
[\[table:market_bias\]](#table:market_bias){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:market_bias"}, each number represents the value of one
training example from one dataset when used to test on another. A value
of 0.25 means that you need 4 times more training examples than when
using a sample derived from the same testing distribution. These results
are from 2011 @Torralba2011 and computer vision datasets have evolved
since then.

## Sources of Bias

There are many reasons why datasets are biased. It is important when
designing a new dataset to study first the potential sources of biases
associated with each data collection procedure so as to mitigate those
biases as much as possible. Collecting a diverse and an unbiased dataset
usually translates to improved performance for the downstream task. We
will list here some sources of bias, but this list is far from
exhaustive.

### Photographer Bias

The photographer bias is probably one of the most common biases in image
databases, and surprisingly difficult to get rid of it.

In a beautiful study, Steve Palmer et al @Palmer1981 showed participants
photographs of objects with different orientations in order to measure
what orientations they preferred. For each object there were 12
different orientations. Participants had consistent preferrences for
particular viewpoints for each object. Interestingly, those preferences
also correlated with how easy it was to recognize each object. In
another experiment from the same study, participants were shown one
picture and their task was to classify the object as quickly as possible
from a fixed set of twelve known possible classes. The average response
time and accuracy were a measured for each of the
12$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}12 images. The speed and accuracy are a
measure of how easy is to recognize an object under a particular
viewpoint. The study showed that people recognized objects better when
presented in a canonical orientation.
@fig-bias_and_shift:palmer_1981enhanced shows the preferred viewpoint
for the 12 objects studied.

![](figures/bias_and_shift/palmer_1981enhanced.jpg){width="100%"}

The views that are recognized faster also match the viewpoints that are
preferred when taking a picture of those objects @Palmer1981. Such
photographer preferred viewpoint introduces biases on how objects are
captured, and this bias makes the statistics of object pose in
photographs different from the statistics of how objects are actually
seen. The photographer bias exists for objects and scenes (composed of
many objects). When taking pictures of scenes, there are biases on the
preferred viewpoint, camera orientation (e.g., the horizon is usually
inside the picture frame), object locations (such as the one third
rule), object arrangements, positions of shadows, types of occlusions,
position of the sun, time of day, weather, and so on. All of those
factors are taken in consideration (consciously or not) by photographers
when deciding which pictures to take.

When building a benchmark, especially when it is small, it is easy to
introduce another photographer bias which is to take pictures that
"feel" easier to recognize. This might be the right thing to do at
first, when debugging a system, but, if abused, has the risk of leading
us in the wrong direction when choosing which approach works best.

These biases also apply to sequences. When filming, the user will tend
to record people in certain configurations, or have the camera position
in a specific orientation which respect to the main direction of the
action, etc. Movie directors also use a number of techniques to capture
shots that produce special viewpoint distributions.

### Collection Bias

There are many potential data sources, all with different biases;
Egocentric videos, internet images, vacation photographs, video captured
from a moving vehicle, etc. The potential biases from each data source
can be quite significant, and it's often straightforward to identify the
capture technique merely by examining the images in a dataset.

@fig-bias_and_shift:mugs shows the first 22 images returned by Google
for the query "mug." It looks far from a diverse and unbiased collection
of images. As you can appreciate these pictures of mugs look very
different from the visual settings in which one usually encounters mugs
(inside cabinets, on top of a table, inside the dishwasher, or dirty
inside the sink). Instead the images that appear in the search are taken
against a flat background, mostly just white, and under a very canonical
point of view. For instance, there are no views directly from above.
Other biases can be a bit subtle, for example, most of the handles
appear on the right side, and most of the mugs are fully visible,
without any occlusions from hands or other objects, and the only two
cases of occlusions from mugs occluded by another mug.

![](figures/bias_and_shift/mugs-1.png){width="100%"}

The example of the mug, although a bit of a caricature, helps to
understand some of the biases that come from the particular collection
protocol used to collect images. In this case, images on the internet
have a particular type of bias (at least of the ones that get returned
under specific searches).

@fig-bias_and_shift:horses shows images returned when looking for
"horse." Interestingly many of the pictures are similar to the horse
canonical orientation shown in @fig-bias_and_shift:palmer_1981enhanced.

![](figures/bias_and_shift/horses-1.png){width="100%"}

### Annotation Bias

When annotating images, image annotators will choose which images to
annotate and which labels to use. This will also correlate with
viewpoint preferences and other photographer biases as those images
might be easier to annotate and segment, and this has the risk of
compounding with the photographer bias.

Annotations will require making language choices and that are an
important source of bias, especially social bias.

### Social Bias

This type of bias can affect both the images and the associated labels.
Social bias refers to biases associated to how groups of people might be
reflected differently in the data. Social biases can be originated by
the data collection protocol or by existing social biases. Images can be
captured in certain world regions, or contain stereotypes. Labels can
reflect social assumptions and biases. An example of social bias is a
dataset of images and labels that associates doctors with males and
nurses with females.

These types of biases, besides impacting the overall model performance,
can have a negative social impact once they are deployed. It is
important to be aware of those biases, and incorporate techniques to
mitigate their effects. Now it is a good moment for the reader to
revisit chapter
[\[chapter-computer_vision_and_society\]](#chapter:computer_vision_and_society){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-computer_vision_and_society"}.

### Testing and Benchmark Bias

One usually thinks about the biases in the training set, but biases in
the test set can have an even more negative impact on the final system
behavior than the training bias. The test set is what researchers and
engineers use to decide which algorithm is best, or what data collection
is more effective for training. However, there might be little
correlation between the performance measured on the test set and the
final performance of the system during deployment.

In particular, if we compare two training datasets, one biased and
another less biased, by evaluating the performance of a system trained
on them using a biased test dataset, we could reach the conclusion that
the biased dataset is better. 

:::{.column-margin}
Remember that "bias" is
a relative term between two datasets, or between a dataset and the real
world, or a desired distribution. We only have access to the real world
via datasets (which inevitably are biased).

## Adversarial Shifts

The data shifts described previously may be disconcerting, but at least
they are not malicious. Unfortunately, things can get worse. Quite often
the data shift is not just random but adversarial. This may come up
whenever our test setting is under the control of a competing agent, for
example, someone trying to hack our system (computer security), another
animal trying to eat us (evolution), or a trader trying to outperform us
on the stock market (finance). Worse still, the neural nets we have seen
in this book are very easy to fool by an adversary.

### Adversarial Attacks {#sec-bias_and_shift:adversarial_attacks}

This was famously demonstrated by @szegedy2014intriguing, who showed
that one can add imperceptible noise to an image that fools neural net
classifiers despite looking completely innocuous to a human. In fact,
the noise pattern can be selected to force the network to produce any
output the attacker desires. These are called **adversarial attacks**
because we suppose the attacker, who adds the noise, is an adversary
that wants to fool or manipulate your system. The adversary can do this
by simply optimizing the noise pattern to cause the network to make a
particular output, while restricting the noise to be very subtle (within
an small $r$-radius ball around the original image). For example, to
cause an image classifier $f$ to think the cat in
@fig-bias_and_shift:adversarial_perturbation is an ostrich, the
attacker could find the noise pattern via the following optimization:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,max}}_{\mathbf{\epsilon}} H(\mathbf{y}_{\texttt{ostrich}}, f(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{\epsilon})), \quad\quad \text{subject to} \quad\quad \left\lVert\mathbf{\epsilon}\right\rVert < r
\end{aligned}$$ where $H$ is the cross-entropy loss and
$\mathbf{y}_{\texttt{ostrich}}$ is a one-hot code for the ostrich class.

![An adversarial attack that adds subtle changes to the cat photo to make a neural net classify it instead as an ostrich. The noise image color values are scaled 20x for visualization.](./figures/bias_and_shift/adversarial_perturbation_3.png){width="80%"}

This type of attack required that the attacker has access to your system
(the neural net $f$) so that they can optimize the noise pattern
$\mathbf{\epsilon}$ to fool the system. Unfortunately, if you want to
deploy your system to the public, then you have to give people access to
it and that makes it vulnerable to attack.

In chapter
[\[chapter-neural_nets\]](#chapter:neural_nets){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-neural_nets"} we described a simple neural network
for line classification and showed how, by accessing the architecture
and the learned filters, we could manually design input examples that
would get wrongly classified. Similarly, in chapter
[\[chap-downsampling_and_upsampling\]](#chap:downsampling_and_upsampling){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap-downsampling_and_upsampling"} we showed how aliasing
could also create vulnerabilities in a network. For large systems,
adversarial attacks are not manually designed, instead they are the
result of an optimization procedure that optimizes the noise pattern
$\mathbf{\epsilon}$ so that it has a small amplitude (i.e., it is
imperceptible) and makes the system fail with high confidence.

### Defenses

Adversarial analysis is worst case analysis. Remember that we typically
train our systems to minimize empirical risk, defined as the *mean*
error over the training data. Because we only focus on the mean, the
*worst case* might be arbitrarily bad. Alternative approaches try to
minimize worst-case error, and this can result in systems that are more
. In chapter
[\[chapter-data_augmentation\]](#chapter:data_augmentation){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter-data_augmentation"} we will discuss how **adversarial
training** can be used to increase the robustness of the models to
adversarial attacks.

## Concluding Remarks

One way to reduce the issues of dataset bias and shift is to implement a
rigorous data collection procedure that tries to minimize the biases
present in the data. Although it is possible to prevent (or reduce)
certain forms of bias, others will remain challenging because it is hard
to collect the necessary data or because we are not aware of it. In many
cases, deployment will be done in specific settings that might be
unknown a priori. Therefore, bias is here to stay and it is important to
study forms to reduce its methods in the system performance.

There are two general ways of dealing with dataset bias and shift. The
first is called domain randomization, or data augmentation. The second
is called transfer learning, or model adaptation. The next two chapters
are about these options.
